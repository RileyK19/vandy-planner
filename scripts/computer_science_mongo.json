The jazz\nstudies major offers a focus on American and non-Western music traditions while also developing the core\nfundamentals of Western music common to all Blair majors. The integrated studies major combines the study of\ncomposition or a performance area with an additional concentration in music and forms the basis for a five-year\nprogram in teacher education offered cooperatively with Peabody College.

A\nvariety of equipment is available for check out including laptops, microphones, phone chargers, midi keyboards,\nheadphones, and umbrellas. Music librarians and staff are available to assist users with music research and finding\nresources for performance, study, or instruction.\n\nThe Blair Concert Series\nThe Blair Concert Series offers a broad array of music performances to the university community and the region.\nNational and international artists and ensembles, the Blair faculty, including resident ensembles and soloists, and\nstudent ensembles and performers are all featured. All student recitals are open to the public. More than 350\nconcerts are presented at the school each year, and most are free of charge, as a gift to the community.\n\nA milestone in the Blair School's history was “The Blair Commissions: Music for the 21st Century,” a project funded\nby the James Stephen Turner Family Charitable Foundation, which has commissioned several important works by\nrenowned composers from 2005 through 2019. These include works by Susan Botti and Peter Schickele and four\nmajor works by Michael Hersch. Each composition received its premiere in Nashville, and all the works were then\neither recorded or performed in New York. The project has served two intertwined missions: to promote the\ncomposition of outstanding works by the world’s leading composers and to invite attention to the excellent\nensembles and faculty performers of Vanderbilt University.\n\nComposers-in-residence who have visited the Blair School include Robert Beaser, William Bolcom, Susan Botti,\nGeorge Crumb, Michael Daugherty, Lukas Foss, Gabriela Lena Frank, John Harbison, Michael Hersch, Karel Husa,\nSteven Mackey, Donald Martino, Cindy McTee, Jessie Montgomery, Kevin Puts, Christopher Rouse, Adam\nSchoenberg, Joseph Schwantner, Frank Ticheli, Michael Torke, and Joan Tower.\n\nBlair Academy at Vanderbilt\nIndividual, group, class, and ensemble instruction for precollege and adult students",

This designation appears on their diplomas.\nStudy Abroad\nVanderbilt's Global Education Office offers approximately thirty programs that allow students to take engineering or\ncomputer science courses in English abroad, in locations ranging from Dublin to Sydney, Madrid to Hong Kong.\nThere are no language prerequisites for these programs. These programs also allow students to take a range of\nliberal arts core, major core, and elective courses abroad. In no case, after matriculating at Vanderbilt, may a\nstudent participate in a Vanderbilt-approved study abroad program through a different university or through an\nexternal agency and then seek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt. Financial aid can be used for study abroad\nduring the academic year, and scholarships are available to support Vanderbilt-approved summer study abroad\noptions. Students are encouraged to discuss with their academic advisers how best to incorporate study abroad into\ntheir four-year plans of study. All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt’s\ninternational security provider.\n\nRegistration is completed on your behalf when enrolling in a program offered through the Global Education Office.\nOtherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.\nTeacher Education\nStudents who are interested in preparing for licensure as secondary school teachers should plan their programs in\nconsultation with the associate dean in the School of Engineering and the Director of Secondary Education in the\nDepartment of Teaching and Learning at Peabody College. More specific information on professional education\ncourse requirements can be found under the Licensure for Teaching chapter in the Peabody College section of this\ncatalog. Inquiries can also be made to the Office of Teacher Licensure at Peabody.\nSecond Major\nIt is possible for a student to combine an engineering field with a second area outside the School of Engineering.\nThe student must obtain prior approval of each department and satisfy the requirements of each major, including\nthe requirement regarding minimum grade point average. Students in the School of Engineering may use courses\noutside the School of Engineering for relevant second majors even if those courses also fulfill a degree requirement.\n\nCertain double majors involving two programs within the School of Engineering have been approved by the faculty.\nThe approved double majors are biomedical engineering/electrical and computer engineering, and biomedical\nengineering/chemical engineering.\n\nPage 178 of 1019\n\n\fBoth majors are indicated on the student’s transcript. Only one degree is awarded, from the school in which the\nstudent is enrolled.\nMinors\nA minor consists of at least five courses of at least 3 credit hours each within a recognized area of knowledge. A\nminor offers students more than a casual introduction to an area, but less than a major. A minor is not a degree\nrequirement, but students may elect to complete one or more. Courses may not be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. A\nminor for which all designated courses are completed with a grade point average of at least 2.000 will be entered on\nthe transcript at the time of graduation.\n\nWhen a minor is offered in a discipline that offers a major, only those courses that count toward the major may be\ncounted toward the minor. Students should refer to the appropriate sections of this catalog for specific\nrequirements. Minors are offered in engineering management, materials science and engineering, computer\nscience, data science, digital fabrication, electrical and computer engineering, energy and environmental systems,\nenvironmental engi​neering, nanoscience and nanotechnology, quantum information science and engineering,\nscientific computing, and most disciplines of the College of Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, and Peabody\nCollege.\n\nStudents declare their intention to pursue a minor by completing the online Major/Minor Declaration/Change\nworkflow process found here: https://registrar.vanderbilt.edu/registration/forms.php. Departments and programs\nusually assign advisers to students who declare minors in their areas. Students are responsible for knowing and\nsatisfying all requirements for the minors they intend to complete.\nFocus Areas\nFocus areas provide guidance to students wishing to concentrate on a specialized topic within engineering. Focus\nareas are typically nine credit hours, and qualifying courses are listed in the catalog. Students can declare a\nmaximum of three focus areas; however, a qualifying course cannot be applied to more than one focus area.\nStudents interested in declaring a focus area must do so before the start of their final semester at Vanderbilt.\nSuccessful completion of a declared focus area will be designated on a student's transcript upon graduation.\nThe School of Engineering offers the following focus areas:\nHuman Computer Interaction\nMicroelectronics\nNanotechnology\nStrategic and Technical Consulting\nEngineering Communications\nTechnology Entrepreneurship\nProduct Development\nDual Degree Program with Fisk University\nA coordinated dual degree program between the Vanderbilt University School of Engineering and Fisk University is\nespecially designed to permit students to obtain an A.B. degree in biology, chemistry, computer science, physics, or\nmathematics from Fisk and a B.E. degree in engineering from Vanderbilt, generally within five years.\n\nFor the first three years, the student is enrolled at Fisk in a science or mathematics curriculum and, by crossregistration in the second and third years, takes introductory engineering courses at Vanderbilt. During the fourth\nand fifth years, the student is enrolled at Vanderbilt, following principally an engineering curriculum at Vanderbilt\nand completing necessary courses at Fisk. At the end of five years, the student should be able to satisfy the\nrequirements for both bachelor’s degrees.\n\nFinancial aid is available for qualified, deserving students. Additional information is available from the director of\n\nPage 179 of 1019\n\n\ftransfer admissions in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\nIntegrated Bachelor and Master of Engineering\nOn the basis of recommendations containing favorable appraisals of professional promise, undergraduate students\nin the School of Engineering who have completed at least 75 hours by the end of the second year with at least a\n3.500 grade point average may be accepted into an integrated Bachelor of Engineering–Master of Engineering\nprogram.

Lewis, Marlon Thomas\n\nCOURSES OFFERED: BME\n\nThe foundations of biomedical engineering are the same as those in other engineering disciplines: mathematics,\nphysics, chemistry, and engineering principles. Biomedical engineering builds on these foundations to solve\nproblems in biology and medicine over the widest range of scales-from the nanoscale and molecular levels to the\nwhole body. Biomedical engineering provides a robust platform for employment in the medical device and\ninstrumentation industries as well as careers in companies that specialize in the development and application of\nbiologics, biomaterials, computation, implants and processes. Our graduates gain entry into nationally recognized\ngraduate schools for continuing studies in biomedical engineering.\n\nBiomedical engineering is also a rigorous path for admission to and success in medical school for those students\n\nPage 185 of 1019\n\n\fwilling and able to excel in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and engineering.\n\nThe Department of Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt is unique among biomedical engineering programs in its\nimmediate proximity to the world class Vanderbilt Medical Center, located on our compact campus. Our School of\nMedicine is among the top ten in funding from the National Institutes of Health and includes a National Cancer\nInstitute- recognized Comprehensive Cancer Center, a major children’s hospital and a Level I trauma center. This\nproximity and the strong relationships among faculty across multiple schools stimulate high impact research and\nprovide unique educational and research opportunities for students.\n\nDegree Programs. The Department of Biomedical Engineering offers courses of study leading to the B.E., M.S.,\nM.Eng., and Ph.D. Vanderbilt biomedical engineering is a well-established program with undergraduate degrees\ngranted continuously since 1965. Our undergraduate curriculum undergoes regular review and revision to ensure\nrelevancy and to maintain full ABET accreditation. Students have complete flexibility in the selection of biomedical\nengineering, technical, and open electives. This allows students to design their own focus areas such as\nregenerative medicine and tissue engineering, wearables and point-of-care diagnostics, global health, surgery and\nengineering, robotics and prosthetics, lasers and medicine, medical imaging, biotechnology and nanomedicine,\nmedical technology and entrepreneurship.\n\nFacilities. The Department of Biomedical Engineering is located in Stevenson Center. Undergraduate instructional\nlaboratories are equipped for study of biomedical processes, measurement methods and instrumentation. These\nfacilities are equipped with embedded systems for instrumentation, design, and testing that mirror professional\npractice. Specialized facilities for biomedical imaging, biophotonics, cell and tissue culture, microfabrication, surgery\nand intervention, and nanoengineering are used both for faculty-led research and instructional purposes.\n\nUndergraduate Honors Program. With approval of the Honors Program director, junior and senior students in\nbiomedical engineering who have achieved a minimum grade point average of 3.5 may be accepted into the\nundergraduate Honors Program. Students in the program take at least 6 credit hours of 5000-level or above",
