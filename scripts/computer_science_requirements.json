Leadership and Personal Development. Leadership is one of the most compelling topics of our\ntime, and might be one of the most important attributes for effectiveness in all levels of human endeavor. The\nsuccess of one of the most admired and respected institutions in our country, the military, is founded upon the\nunderstanding and effective application of leadership, and the development of leaders. This course introduces\nstudents to the personal challenges and competencies that are critical to effective leadership. The focus is on\ndeveloping basic knowledge and comprehension of leadership attributes and core leader competencies in a\nuniversal setting and exploring potential applications of these principles and practices at Vanderbilt, in the military\nand in the corporate world. [1]\n\nMS-PC 1210L. Leadership and Personal Development Lab. Leader development is a continuous process of\ntraining, assessment and feedback with the goal of instilling and enhancing desirable behavior in individuals and\norganizations. Within the military science curriculum, this process is called the Leadership Development Program\n(LDP), modeled after the principles spelled out in Field Manual 22-100, Army Leadership, and is standardized both\non campus and in Advanced Camp environments. The flexible methodology of LDP accommodates personalized,\nindividual development at all levels of proficiency throughout the officer educational experience, from program\nentry to commissioning. The LDP includes basic leadership training, periodic assessment and counseling at both\nteam and individual levels by experienced observers. Trends and deficiencies are identified and addressed with\nretraining and reassessment in a continuous cycle. Effective leader development is progressive, building on lessons\nlearned and maximizing individual potential. This course introduces students to the leadership development process\nby providing structured leadership opportunities in a variety of training settings. Student performance in leadership\nroles is assessed and notable strengths and weaknesses are identified. A plan for improvement is discussed in detail\nduring one-on-one counseling sessions.

All available information is considered, including secondary school\nacademic record, evidence of academic maturity and independence, extracurricular activities, contributions to and\nimpact on the school and community, scores on standardized tests if submitted (see #3 in Application Procedure\nbelow), and letters of recommendation.\n\nThe admissions process supports the university's mission of scholarship and discovery and is designed to select a\nstudent body with exceptional academic talent, high standards of personal character, serious educational aims, and\nwide-ranging backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Policies that govern the selection process have been set\n\nPage 32 of 1019\n\n\fby the vice provost for university enrollment affairs. Please refer to the nondiscrimination statement which appears\nearlier in this catalog.\n\nAdmission to the four undergraduate schools is managed by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\n\nProspective students are encouraged to investigate the university by visiting the campus, exploring the Office of\nUndergraduate Admissions website, connecting via social media, and attending college fairs and other programs\nhosted by Vanderbilt admissions officers across the country, around the world, and online. Admissions staff are\navailable to answer questions, assist with understanding campus visit opportunities, provide additional information\nabout degree programs, and link visitors with appropriate campus offices and members of the university community.\nAcademic Preparation\nEvery candidate for admission must present an official transcript of work completed in high school. While our\nadmissions process is holistic, most successful candidates will present a curriculum that includes the equivalent of\nfive academic subjects each year for four years. Recommended course work includes 4 units of English, 4 units of\nmathematics, 4 units of natural science, 2 units of foreign language, 2 units of social science/humanities, and 4 units\nof additional course work in these areas, or other academic courses such as engineering science, computer science,\nsocial science or natural science research, or advanced work in the humanities. Close attention will be paid to the\nrigor of course work presented. It is highly recommended that candidates applying to the School of Engineering have\ntaken calculus, calculus-based physics, and chemistry.\n\nMost successful candidates will have meaningfully engaged with the academic, intellectual, social, and leadership\nopportunities available in the context of their high schools and communities. In exceptionally rare cases, students\nmay be considered for admission before completing four years of high school. In these cases, the Admissions\nCommittee considers especially evidence of maturity and readiness for an immersive, residential college\nexperience.\nApplication Procedure — First-year Applicants",

The small-group nature of these seminars allows for direct student-faculty interaction that stresses\ntraining in techniques of scholarly inquiry. The students’ written work and oral presentations are subject to\nthoughtful critical review by the faculty member, providing feedback that can be used to reconsider the manner in\nwhich they articulate their ideas and to refine their skills in these areas. Thus, first-year students learn not only\nabout the subject matter of the seminar, but are also exposed to new methods of acquiring knowledge, different\nways of expressing and sharing ideas, and unique opportunities to participate in critical inquiry.\n\nAll first-year students must enroll in a First-Year Writing Seminar. (First-Year Writing Seminars in the College of Arts\nand Science are numbered 1111.) This course may be taken during the fall or the spring semester. Students are\npermitted to enroll in only one First-Year Writing Seminar per semester. All First-Year Writing Seminars also count in\ntheir appropriate distribution areas within the Liberal Arts Requirement, but a second seminar will not count toward\nthe writing requirement. Students who transfer into the College of Arts and Science (whether from another school at\nVanderbilt or from another college or university) do not complete a First-Year Writing Seminar. Students beyond\ntheir second semester in residence may not register for First-Year Writing Seminars, nor may First- Year Writing\nSeminars be repeated after completion of the second semester in residence.\n\nThe Writing Requirement\nExcellent communication skills, including the ability to articulate ideas and defend positions in writing, will be\nparamount for the 21st-century graduates of Vanderbilt University; therefore, all students in the College of Arts and\nScience must successfully complete the Writing Requirement.\na. All students must demonstrate competence in English composition. Appropriate skills in composition are\nessential to successful progress at the Competence is demonstrated by completion of ENGL 1100 or any of\nthe following test-based or transfer-credit satisfiers:\ni. SAT: Combined score of at least 1220 on the Writing and Critical Reasoning sections, with a minimum\nscore of 500 on each (test taken prior to March 2016).\nii. SAT: Score of at least 660 on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section.\niii. ACT: Score of at least 30 on the English portion (beginning October 2016).\niv. AP: Minimum score of 4 on the English Language or English Literature exam.\nv. IB: Minimum score of 6 on the Higher level English\nvi. Transfer credit for English 1100\nvii. Transfer credit for English 1210W, 1220W, 1230W, 1250W, 1260W, 1270W, or 1300W. (If used to\nsatisfy the English composition requirement, the transfer credit does NOT also count as the W course\nrequired to achieve junior standing.\nb. First-Year Writing Seminar (see above).\nc. All students must successfully complete at least one Arts and Science writing course (indicated by a “W”) at\nVanderbilt University, regardless of AP or IB credits, SAT scores, or ACT scores earned prior to matriculation.\nThe 1000-level writing-intensive courses emphasize general writing skills within the context of disciplinespecific subject matter. The 2000 and higher-level writing-intensive courses foster advanced, disciplinespecific writing skills. Departments or programs that offer these courses determine their specific writing In\n2000 or higher-level W courses, continued attention to the process of writing is included in the classroom.\nStudents receive regular feedback on their writing that will contribute toward enhancing writing skills\nappropriate to specific disciplines. The process of revising written work allows students to reflect on the\nwriting process; writing tutorials may also be included. All students are required to complete a W course\n\nPage 106 of 1019\n\n\f(other than ENGL 1100 or a First-Year Writing Seminar) no later than the fourth semester. All Arts and\nScience W courses also count in their appropriate distribution areas within the Liberal Arts Requirement.\nd. All students must successfully complete either a second Arts and Science W course (other than ENGL 1100 or\na First-Year Writing Seminar), or an approved course in oral communication (CMST 2100, 2110, 2120) at\nVanderbilt University, regardless of AP or IB credits, SAT scores, or ACT scores earned prior to Oral\ncommunication courses focus on developing improved public speaking skills. These courses introduce\nstudents to the principles and practices of public discourse and reasoned argument. Attention to the process\nof effective oral communication is integral to these classes. Students receive regular speaking assignments\nthroughout the semester and regular feedback to enhance effective speaking skills. All students must\ncomplete Part d of the Writing Requirement before graduation.\n\nThe Liberal Arts Requirement\nThe Liberal Arts Requirement consists of successful completion of thirteen courses from the College of Arts and\nScience. Most courses in the College of Arts and Science fulfill one of these Liberal Arts requirements. Courses must\ncarry three or more credits to count toward the AXLE Liberal Arts Requirement. Although some courses may be\nappropriate to more than one requirement, each course will fulfill only one requirement. These thirteen courses\nmust be distributed as outlined below. They must be taken from at least seven departments or subject areas.\n\na. Humanities and the Creative Arts — HCA (3 courses)\nCourses in the humanities and the creative arts challenge students to examine their personal understanding of life\nand how their individual experiences overlap with those of the rest of humankind. These courses testify to the\nvarying ways in which people think, form values, confront ambiguity, express spiritual and aesthetic yearnings, and\ngrapple with moral and ethical problems. By analyzing and interpreting literary, philosophical, religious, or artistic\nworks, students examine the foundations of human experience. By producing original artistic works in imaginative\nwriting, studio art, theatre, film, music, and dance, students have the opportunity to connect the universal sources\nof human inspiration with their own creative processes.\n\nb. International Cultures — INT (3 courses)\nThe study of international cultures provides students with a basis for understanding the diversity of experiences and\nvalues in our contemporary, global society. Options in this category include not only international history and\ncultural studies courses, but also courses in literature, cinema and media arts, the social sciences, art, music, and\nlanguages. Students may satisfy this requirement by choosing courses that focus on the history and culture of a\nsingle society or time period in human history and/or that represent a broad spectrum of different human societies\nand time periods.\nLanguage courses introduce students to the language of a different culture and provide insight into that culture in\nways that are not possible to achieve through detached study. At intermediate and advanced levels, students are\nable to explore the culture in depth, using the language itself to read, discuss, and write about its various aspects.\nEven at the most basic level, exposure to the language of a different culture prepares students to think and act in\nterms of living in a global community.\n\nIntermediate and advanced language courses prepare students for study abroad programs, which the College of\nArts and Science strongly recommends. A maximum of one course in this requirement may be satisfied through\nstudy abroad in a Vanderbilt-approved program. A summer study abroad program must earn 6 or more credit hours\nto satisfy this requirement.\n\nThe Global Education Office maintains a list of pre-approved programs.\n\nNote: All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt’s international security\nprovider. Registration is completed on your behalf if you enroll in a program offered through the Global Education\nOffice. Otherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.\n\nPage 107 of 1019\n\n\fAll students must complete three courses in this category, irrespective of previous language study or proficiency in\na language other than English. At least one of the three courses presented in fulfillment of this category must be a\nsecond-semester (or higher) language acquisition class taught at Vanderbilt University (or through the Duke–UVa–\nVanderbilt Partnership for Less Commonly Taught Languages), unless the student successfully demonstrates\nproficiency in a language other than English at or above the level achieved by second-semester language\nacquisition classes taught at Vanderbilt University. Students may demonstrate proficiency in a number of ways: SAT\nSubject Test scores (French, 540; German, 470; Hebrew, 530; Italian, 540; Japanese with Listening, 440; Latin, 530;\nSpanish, 520); by appropriate score on proficiency tests (written and oral) administered by the Tennessee Language\nCenter; or with AP or IB credit in a foreign language. The first semester of an introductory language acquisition class\nin any language a student has studied for at least two years in high school, or in which a student transfers credit\nfrom another institution, cannot be used in partial fulfillment of this requirement. Intensive elementary language\ncourses that cover the content of two semesters in one shall count as one course toward this category.\n\nStudents who, because of special ability and achievement, are admitted to the College of Arts and Science without\nthe normally required two years of one foreign language in high school must enroll in a foreign language course\nduring their first semester and must remain continuously enrolled until they successfully complete a full year of one\nforeign language. They must complete this requirement by the end of their fourth semester in the College of Arts\nand Science.\n\nc. History and Culture of the United States — US (1 course)\nThe study of the history and culture of the United States provides students with a basis for understanding the\nAmerican experience and the shaping of American values and viewpoints within the context of an increasingly global\nsociety. Interpreting history and culture in the broadest sense, options in this category include traditional history and\ncultural studies courses, but also courses in literature, cinema and media arts, the social sciences, art, and music,\nwhich illuminate historical periods or cultural themes in United States history. Students may satisfy this requirement\nby choosing a course that focuses on the history and culture of a single social group or time period in American\nhistory and/or that represents a broad spectrum of different social groups and time periods.\n\nd. Mathematics and Natural Sciences — MNS (3 courses, one of which must be a laboratory science)\nCourses in mathematics emphasize quantitative reasoning and prepare students to describe, manipulate, and\nevaluate complex or abstract ideas or arguments with precision. Skills in mathematical and quantitative reasoning\nprovide essential foundations for the study of natural and social sciences. Students are generally introduced to\nmathematical reasoning through the study of introductory courses in calculus or probability and statistics.\n\nCourses in the natural sciences engage students in hypothesis-driven quantitative reasoning that helps to explain\nnatural phenomena, the roles of testing and replication of experimental results, and the processes through which\nscientific hypotheses and theories are developed, modified, or abandoned in the face of more complete evidence, or\nintegrated into more general conceptual structures. Laboratory science courses engage students in methods of\nexperimental testing of hypotheses and analysis of data that are the hallmarks of the natural sciences. Natural\nscience courses prepare students to understand the complex interactions between science, technology, and society;\nteach students to apply scientific principles to everyday experience; and develop the capacity to distinguish\nbetween science and what masquerades as science.\n\ne. Social and Behavioral Sciences — SBS (2 courses)\nSocial scientists endeavor to study human behavior at the levels of individuals, their interactions with others, their\nsocietal structures, and their social institutions. The remarkable scope represented by these disciplines extends\nfrom studying the underpinnings of brain function to the dynamics of human social groups to the structures of\npolitical and economic institutions. The methods employed by social scientists are correspondingly broad, involving\napproaches as varied as mapping brain activity, discovering and charting ancient cultures, identifying the societal\nforces that shape individual and group behavior, and using mathematics to understand economic phenomena. By\nstudying how humans and societies function, students will learn about individual and societal diversity, growth, and\nchange.\n\nPage 108 of 1019\n\n\ff. Perspectives — P (1 course)\nCourses in Perspectives give significant attention to individual and cultural diversity, multicultural interactions,\nsexual orientation, gender, racial, ethical, and religious issues within a culture across time or between cultures,\nthereby extending the principles and methods associated with the liberal arts to the broader circumstances in which\nstudents live. These courses emphasize the relationship of divergent ethics and moral values to contemporary social\nissues and global conflicts.\n\nThe Major\nAll students must successfully complete a course of study leading to one of the approved major programs in the\nCollege of Arts and Science, or successfully complete an individually designed interdisciplinary major designed in\nconsultation with College of Arts and Science faculty and approved by the Committee on Individual Programs in the\nCollege of Arts and Science.\n\nAXLE Curriculum Course Distribution\nThe distribution of Arts and Science courses into AXLE categories is available in YES. Using the advanced-classsearch dialog box, use the pull-down menu under “Class Attributes” to select an AXLE category.\n\nAXLE, the Major, and the Optional Minor\nCourses used to satisfy requirements of AXLE may also be used to satisfy requirements of the major or the optional\nminor.\n\nAdvanced Placement under AXLE\nWith the exception of basic English composition and the foreign language proficiency requirements, no AXLE\nrequirement may be fulfilled with any form of advanced placement credit (AP, IB, A-level, etc.).\n\nTransfer Credit under AXLE\nGenerally, only courses taken in the College of Arts and Science may be used toward AXLE; however, any college\ncourse credit earned prior to graduation from high school, and transfer credit earned before admission to\nVanderbilt, may be used toward fulfilling AXLE requirements.\n\nArea of Concentration\nDuring the junior and senior years, much of the student’s work is concentrated in one large unit of intellectually\nrelated courses. The program of concentration may be arranged through a single major, an interdisciplinary major,\nor a double major. Each of the three options is described below. A triple major may be declared with the approval of\nthe Administrative Committee.\n\nMajor Field\nUnder this plan, the student majors in one of the recognized fields. There shall not be fewer than 27 credit hours in\nthe major field, but a given department may require up to 48 credit hours. Students may take more than the\nrequired number of credit hours in any major; any given department, however, may limit the total permissible credit\n\nPage 109 of 1019\n\n\fhours in a discipline.\n\nFor graduation, a student must have achieved a grade point average of at least 2.000 in all classes taken in the\nmajor. This set of courses includes all courses a student takes in the department or program of the major and all\ncourses a student takes outside the department or program that may count toward the major. All courses that are\nlisted as fulfilling credit hours required for the major, as listed in the Undergraduate Catalog, are included in\ncalculating the grade point average in the major.\n\nWithin the framework of these general requirements, each department has its own policies governing major work,\nwhich are published elsewhere in this catalog or otherwise available to students.\n\nAcademic programs of the College of Arts and Science are varied and broad in scope, with departmental majors\noffered in the following fields:\n\nAfrican American and Diaspora Studies\nAnthropology\nArchitecture and the Built Environment\nArt\nAsian Studies\nBiological Sciences\nChemistry\nCinema and Media Arts\nCommunication Studies\nEarth and Environmental Sciences\nEcology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology\nEconomics\nEnglish\nEnvironmental Sociology\nFrench\nGender and Sexuality Studies\nGerman Studies\n\nHistory\nHistory of Art and Architecture\nJewish Studies\nLaw, History, and Society\nMathematics\nMedicine, Health, and Society\nMolecular and Cellular Biology\nPhilosophy\nPhysics\nPolitical Science\nPsychology\nReligious Studies\nRussian Studies\nSociology\nSpanish\nSpanish and Portuguese\nTheatre\n\nDefined Interdisciplinary Programs\nStudents may also major in defined interdisciplinary programs (listed below). There shall not be fewer than 27 credit\nhours in the major field, but a given program may require up to 48 credit hours. The student must achieve at least a",

There is no formal predental program of courses at Vanderbilt. Predental studies\nshould include courses necessary to meet dental school admission requirements, all courses required for the major,\nall AXLE requirements, and elective options. Students may choose majors from any of the four undergraduate\ncolleges. They may also elect a double major or an interdisciplinary program of concentration. A student may apply\n\nPage 115 of 1019\n\n\fto dental school under the senior-in-absentia program (see Senior-in-Absentia in this catalog) or apply for admission\nafter three years of college work without a degree.\n\nAny student contemplating application to dental school should take at least two semesters of English, four\nsemesters of chemistry including organic, two semesters of biology, two semesters of physics, and at least one\nsemester of calculus/math. Since prerequisites may vary across dental schools, students are urged to consult the\nADEA Official Guide to Dental Schools published by the American Association of Dental Schools.\n\nNursing\nStudents interested in developing a program that could lead to a master of science in nursing are advised to consult\nthe Office of Admissions in the School of Nursing.\n\nArchitecture\nUndergraduate students in the College of Arts and Science expecting to pursue architecture at the graduate level\nshould complete at least one year of analytic geometry and calculus and one year of physics. Students may select\nany major but would want to include courses that emphasize a broad sense of art and architectural history,\nincluding courses in studio art. Before applying to specific schools of architecture, they would develop a portfolio of\ncreative work. Further information is available from the pre-architecture advisers: Professor Vesna Pavlović,\nDepartment of Art, and Professor Kevin Murphy, Department of the History of Art and Architecture.\n\nEngineering\nUndergraduate students in the College of Arts and Science expecting to pursue engineering at the graduate level\nshould normally major in a natural science or mathematics and, at a minimum, should complete two years of\ncalculus or its equivalent, one year each of chemistry and physics, and at least an additional year of a natural\nscience or mathematics. A minimum of one year of computer science is highly desirable. Students should seek\nspecific information concerning admission from the engineering school of their choice as early as possible,\npreferably by the end of the sophomore year, to assure optimum preparation for entry into that school. Standards\nfor admission vary, but usually a 3.00 average or better is required.\n\nLaw\nThere is no formal program of prelaw studies at Vanderbilt. Most law schools have no specific requirements for a\nprelaw curriculum but place great emphasis on the development of the student’s ability to read and comprehend\naccurately, thoroughly, and rapidly; to speak and write clearly and correctly; to think precisely; and to analyze\ncomplex situations and weigh and appraise their several elements. The development of analytical skills and of\nmature study habits is vital. A broad cultural background is important—since law touches life at every point, every\nsubject in the college curriculum may bear on the lawyer’s work. Students interested in the study of law should plan\ntheir undergraduate programs in consultation with Dean Carrie Russell, prelaw adviser, in the Dean’s Office of\nUndergraduate Education.\n\nTeacher Education\nDetails will be found in Licensure for Teaching in the Peabody College section of this catalog.\n\nInternships\nStudents may earn academic credit for the work of internships in the College of Arts and Science on a Pass/Fail basis\n\nPage 116 of 1019\n\n\fthrough interdisciplinary or departmental internships. Credit hours earned will not count toward major or minor\nrequirements or toward AXLE, but will count as part of the total credit hours required for graduation. Students obtain\ntheir own placement and faculty adviser who works with them to develop a list of readings or research agenda for\nthe internship, which must be approved by the director of internships in the College of Arts and Science (Associate\nDean Daniel Morgan). The necessary forms for earning academic credit for an internship may be obtained from the\nDean’s Office of Undergraduate Education in 350 Buttrick Hall, although students register for internships through\ntheir respective school. The deadline for submitting registration forms to the office of Dean Jones for internship\ncourses taken during summer term and fall semester is May 1. Students expecting to intern during the spring\nsemester should submit registration forms by January 1.\n\nFinding an Internship\nStudents searching for an internship opportunity locally or elsewhere should contact the Career Center.\n\nInterdisciplinary Internships\nINDS 3880 (fall, spring), 3884 (summer). 1 credit hour (repeatable)\n\nAny student who is at least a sophomore and in good academic standing may earn one credit hour per semester or\nsummer for an internship under this designation. This course may be repeated twice for a maximum of 3 credit\nhours exclusively on a Pass/Fail basis.\n\nDepartmental Internships\nMaximum of 15 credit hours (may be taken only once)\n\nUnder this option students from any discipline may earn academic credit for internships in the departments listed\nbelow if they meet the minimum GPA requirements and have 6 credit hours of prior work in the department in which\nthey wish to intern. Students are responsible for securing a faculty adviser for the internship and developing an\nacademic plan of work for the internship opportunity, both of which must be approved by the director of\nundergraduate studies in the department in which the internship is housed. (In some instances, the DUS will serve\nas the faculty adviser for all internships taken in that discipline.) All internships under this designation are taken\nconcurrently with a research and/or readings course. The latter is taken on a graded basis and may count toward\nrequirements for a major or minor. Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies in the department\nof interest to obtain additional information about internships in that discipline. The following departments offer up to\n15 credit hours of academic credit per semester or summer for the following courses (internship courses are offered\nduring FALL, SPRING, and SUMMER sessions):\n\nAADS 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3–6].\nAMER 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–6], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3–6].\nANTH 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1–6].\nBCB 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1–6].\nCLAS 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1–6].\nCMA 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1–6].\nEES 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3–6].\nFREN 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training in France [1], 3881: Internship Readings and Research in France [3].\nGSS (formerly WGS) 3880, 3882–3883. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3882: Internship Readings [1–3], 3883:\n\nPage 117 of 1019\n\n\fInternship Research [1–3].\nHART 3880, 3883. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3883: Internship Research [1–3].\nHIST 3880, 3882–3883. 3880: Internship Training [3–9], 3882: Internship Readings [3], 3883: Internship Research\n[3].\nJS 3880, 3883. 3880: Internship Training [1–3], 3883: Internship Research [3].\nLAS 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3-6].\nMHS 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1–6].\nPSCI 3880, 3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1-6].\nPSY 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3–6].\nRUSS 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3–6].\nSOC 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3–6].\nSPAN 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training in Spain [1], 3881: Internship Readings and Research in Spain [3].\n\nMore complete information regarding departmental internship courses may be found in the course descriptions in\nthis catalog.\n\nCost of an Internship\nInternships taken during the fall or spring semester will fall under the normal tuition charge unless the student falls\nbelow 12 or exceeds 18 credit hours during the semester. In both instances, the hourly tuition charge will apply with\npermission for an underload/overload from the appropriate academic dean. Students will be charged for internships\ntaken during summer on the basis of the hourly tuition rate for summer school unless approved in advance to\nreceive the internship subsidy (see the Career Center website).\n\nCombined B.A./M.A. (4+1) Program\nThe College of Arts and Science offers students in many departments and programs the opportunity to earn both the\nbachelor’s degree and the master’s degree in a shorter period of time and at less cost than is normally the case.\n\nExceptional students in the College of Arts and Science can obtain both degrees in an expedited period, typically\nwithin, but not less than, five years.\nThe usual period of study for both the bachelor’s and the master’s degree is six years. Through the 4+1 option, the\nstudent and her or his adviser plan a five-year program of study. It is important to note that there is no provision for\nobtaining both degrees in a period shorter than five years. The program is intended for selected students for whom\nthe master’s degree is sufficient preparation for their career goals, is desirable as a goal in itself, or is viewed as\nadditional preparation before pursuing a doctorate or a professional degree.\n\nThe areas of study available for the Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) option within Arts and Science are determined by\nindividual departments and programs, which also determine the policies and guidelines to be followed. Students will\nbe admitted to the Combined B.A./M.A. program only by the invitation and the approval of the department or\nprogram.\n\nPrograms of Study\n\nPage 118 of 1019\n\n\fThe 4+1 option is currently available in the following departments and programs: English; French; German; History;\nHistory of Art and Architecture; Latin American Studies; Mathematics; Medicine, Health, and Society; Philosophy;\nPolitical Science; and Psychology. Students are welcome to discuss the Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) option with any of\nthese departments and programs.\n\nAdmissions Overview\nThe Combined B.A./M.A program allows Vanderbilt University students to study for both degrees typically, but not\nnecessarily, in the same department. Undergraduates with strong academic records may apply for admission to the\nprogram after the first semester of their junior year. Qualifying students are normally accepted into the program in\nthe second semester of the junior year.\n\nTo apply for admission, students will first consult with the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education (350 Buttrick\nHall), and then submit to the prospective graduate department or program a “Petition to Apply to the Combined\nB.A./M.A. (4+1) Degree Program” (available at as.vanderbilt.edu/academics/specialdegree/4plus1.php), a statement\nof purpose, a formal application to the Graduate School, a preliminary program proposal, two letters of\nrecommendation from Vanderbilt faculty, and a current transcript. Application forms are available for download or\ncan be completed online at vanderbilt.edu/gradschool. GRE scores or other admissions requirements may be\nspecified by the prospective department. Admission to the 4+1 option is highly selective. An accomplished\nacademic record, a demonstrated commitment to pursue graduate study, and a strong endorsement from\nVanderbilt faculty are key elements to the successful applicant. Students will be provisionally accepted as graduate\nstudents, pending completion of all undergraduate requirements. Graduate student status will apply in the fifth\nyear.\n\nAdvising\nProspective students should discuss with one of their advisers general information on the program and whether this\nprogram is appropriate to their long-term goals. All students are encouraged to discuss their plans and goals with\ntheir undergraduate pre-major and major adviser. Especially in cases where the intended graduate program differs\nfrom the undergraduate major, the student is further encouraged to seek advice from the advisers in the graduate\nprogram.\n\nCurriculum\nStudents in a 4+1 program must satisfy all requirements for both degrees. Advanced Placement (AP) credits will\noften be used toward satisfying general curriculum requirements, for a maximum of 18 credit hours. The principal\ndistinction between this program and the standard graduate program is two-fold: (1) students are allowed to take\nmaster’s courses while completing the bachelor’s degree, and (2) students are thereby enabled to complete both\ndegrees within five years.\n\nIn order to complete the program in five years, students will be expected to complete most, if not all, of the\nrequirements for their undergraduate degree by the end of the first semester of the senior year. Until all\nbaccalaureate requirements are fulfilled, the student will follow College of Arts and Science undergraduate policies\nand procedures. It is also suggested that students begin taking graduate courses toward the master’s degree in the\nsecond semester of the senior year. Most graduate programs participating in this option have a non-thesis plan of\nstudy requiring 30 graduate credit hours in addition to the requirements for the undergraduate degree. An average\nload per semester as a graduate student is 9–12 credit hours.\n\nScholarships and Financial Aid\nStudents who are receiving scholarships or other forms of financial aid as a Vanderbilt undergraduate are advised\nthat such aid applies in most cases only toward the completion of the bachelor’s degree or the first four years of\ntheir studies (which may include their taking some graduate courses during their senior year). Students wishing to\n\nPage 119 of 1019\n\n\fpursue the 4+1 option should seek support for their fifth year of study through student loans and other financial aid.\n\nFor additional information, contact A&S Deans’ Office, 350 Buttrick Hall, or consult the website\nas.vanderbilt.edu/academics/specialdegree/4plus1.php .\n\nHonors in the College of Arts and Science\nFounder's Medal\nLatin Honors Designation\nCollege Scholars Program\nDepartmental Honors\nDean's List\nPhi Beta Kappa\nHonor Societies for First-Year Students\nOther Awards and Prizes\nFounder’s Medal\nThe Founder’s Medal, signifying first honors, was endowed by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt as one of his gifts to\nthe university. The recipient is named by the Dean after consideration of faculty recommendations and overall\nacademic achievements, as well as grade point averages of the year’s highest ranking summa cum laude graduates.\n\nLatin Honors Designation\nHonors noted on diplomas and published in the Commencement program are earned as follows:\n\nSumma Cum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the top 5 percent of the previous\nthree years’ Arts and Science graduating seniors.\nMagna Cum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the next 8 percent of the previous\nthree years’ Arts and Science graduating seniors.\nCum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the next 12 percent of the previous three\nyears’ Arts and Science graduating seniors.\n\nCollege Scholars Program\nThe College Scholars Program is the honors program for the College of Arts and Science. All first-year students in the\nCollege of Arts & Science are invited to apply at the end of their first semester. Students are selected to participate\nin the College Scholars program based on their academic record and achievements from their first semester on\ncampus. These students have the opportunity to pursue advanced scholarly work in honors seminars and enriched\ncourses or independent-studies projects. The College Scholars program is open only to Arts and Science students.\n\nCollege Scholars may achieve the designation “Honors in the College of Arts and Science” on their diplomas by\nacquiring fifteen “honors points” in the program. The honors points system encourages breadth and depth. Students\naccomplish these goals by taking honors seminars in several AXLE categories and by doing independent projects\n(independent studies, enriching courses, departmental honors research, internships, service, and creative projects).\nA maximum of thirteen points may be earned in honors seminars, and a minimum of two research projects must be\ncompleted to earn fifteen points. Students must earn a grade of “B” or better in classes that earn honors points. To\nremain in good standing in the program, students must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.000.\n\nPage 120 of 1019\n\n\fFurther information on the College Scholars program and honors in the College of Arts and Science may be obtained\nfrom Associate Dean Dan Morgan.\n\nDepartmental Honors\nTo encourage individual development and independent study within their field, many departments and\ninterdisciplinary programs of the College of Arts and Science offer honors programs for selected, superior\ncandidates. Students often begin departmental honors work in the junior year, but some projects start in the senior\nyear. To qualify for consideration, students must have (a) attained a minimum grade point average of 3.300 in all\nwork previously taken for credit and in the major, and (b) exhibited to the department(s) and/or interdisciplinary\nprogram(s) other evidence of the student’s capacity for independent study. Some departments and interdisciplinary\nprograms require higher grade point averages in all work previously taken for credit and/or in the major. Formal\nadmission is by the director of honors study in the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education after nomination by\nthe department(s) and/or interdisciplinary program(s) concerned.\n\nRequirements to complete departmental honors vary from department to department (see descriptions in the\nappropriate department sections of this catalog). Candidates are required to demonstrate some degree of originality\nand maturity in the methods of independent investigation, analysis, and criticism, and skill in the written\npresentation of independent work. This standard usually requires a senior thesis but may be satisfied, in\ndepartments that have gained approval of this procedure, by a series of briefer critical papers.\n\nDepartmental honors work culminates in an examination given in the second semester of the senior year. The\nexamination shall be both oral and written except in departments where honors students must take all courses\nrequired of standard majors in addition to those required of honors students. These departments have the option of\nmaking the examination either oral or both oral and written. The examination shall be conducted by a committee\nwith a majority of examiners who have not participated in the candidate’s honors work. Where feasible, examiners\nfrom other institutions may be included. The examination shall cover the thesis and specific fields of the\nindependent work and may, at the discretion of the department, include all of the major work. Successful candidates\nare awarded honors or highest honors in their field, and this designation appears on their diplomas.\n\nDean’s List\nThe Dean’s List recognizes outstanding academic performance in a semester. Students are named to the Dean’s List\nwhen they earn a grade point average of at least 3.500 while carrying 12 or more graded credit hours, with no\ntemporary or missing grades in any course (credit or non-credit), and no grade of F. A student must be in a degreegranting school.\n\nPhi Beta Kappa\nThe Alpha Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in the state of Tennessee honors scholarly attainments in the liberal arts and\nsciences and annually elects seniors and juniors to membership during the spring semester.\n\nSeniors who have completed at least 60 credit hours in the College of Arts and Science and earned a cumulative\ngrade point average of 3.65 or higher are eligible for consideration, as are juniors who have completed at least 70\ncredit hours at Vanderbilt with a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.90. Juniors must have completed most\nAXLE requirements by the end of their junior year. For calculating credit hours and judging residence requirements,\nthe chapter treats foreign study programs in the same manner as does the College of Arts and Science.\n\nAttainment of the minimum required grade point average does not guarantee election. Membership in Phi Beta\nKappa is based on a demonstration of scholarly achievements, broad cultural interests, and high moral character.\n\nPage 121 of 1019\n\n\fThe scholarly work must emphasize liberal rather than applied or professional studies. As a guideline, for seniors at\nleast 90 credit hours must qualify as liberal. Grades earned in applied (vocational) or professional course work are\nnot counted in computing the grade point average. The breadth of a candidate’s program, as shown by the number\nand variety of courses taken outside the major, is also considered.\n\nPhi Beta Kappa has long emphasized the importance of mathematics and foreign language in a liberal education. In\nkeeping with this tradition, the chapter considers only those students who have demonstrated proficiency in these\nareas beyond the AXLE graduation requirements. Proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking a foreign language is\ntypically demonstrated by passing a course in a language at a level at least one semester beyond the AXLE\nrequirements. Courses must be taken on a graded rather than a P/F basis. The foreign language requirement may\nbe satisfied with College Board SAT Subject, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or Tennessee\nLanguage Center test scores.\n\nMathematics proficiency may be demonstrated by completing two semesters of calculus or one semester of calculus\nand one semester of statistics. Courses must be taken on a graded rather than a P/F basis. The mathematics\nrequirement may be satisfied with Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A-Level exam credit, but\nnot College Board SAT Subject test scores.\n\nIn no event may the total number of persons elected from any senior class exceed 10 percent of the class, and from\nany junior class exceed six persons. Eligible juniors who are not elected are reconsidered for membership in their\nsenior year.\n\nRefer to the chapter website my.vanderbilt.edu/phibetakappa for additional information and detailed eligibility\ncriteria.\n\nHonor Societies for First-Year Students\nFirst-year students who earn a grade point average of 3.500 or better for their first semester are eligible for\nmembership in the Vanderbilt chapters of Phi Eta Sigma and Alpha Lambda Delta.\n\nOther Awards and Prizes\nMORRIS H.

Graduates of the Blair School are recognized as superior artists and scholars distinguished by their global\nmindsets, broad interdisciplinary competencies, and unyielding commitments to advocacy, entrepreneurship, and\neducation.\n\nThe Blair School has been an integral part of Nashville’s musical environment since its founding in 1964 by the Justin\nand Valere Potter Foundation through a bequest of Valere Blair Potter. In 1981 the school was merged with\nVanderbilt following the university’s decision to develop an excellent program in music. Studies leading to the\nprofessional bachelor of music in performance were initiated in 1986.\n\nThe Bachelor of Music degree program includes majors in performance, composition, jazz studies, and integrated\nstudies. The performance major is available in any orchestral instrument, piano, saxophone, euphonium, and voice.\nThe major in composition emphasizes analytical skills as well as the development of students’ creativity. The jazz\nstudies major offers a focus on American and non-Western music traditions while also developing the core\nfundamentals of Western music common to all Blair majors. The integrated studies major combines the study of\ncomposition or a performance area with an additional concentration in music and forms the basis for a five-year\nprogram in teacher education offered cooperatively with Peabody College. In the Bachelor of Musical Arts degree\nprogram, composers and performers complete an in-depth music study in addition to a field outside of music.\n\nA non-professional 31-hour liberal arts music major makes it possible for students outside the Blair School to choose\nmusic as a second major. Students in other schools and colleges of the university also may pursue a minor in music,\nmusic composition, musicology/ethnomusicology, or music performance. And Blair offers a remarkable variety of\nelectives for students who wish to enrich their studies with credit in music courses, ensembles, or performance\ninstruction, or to select music as an extracurricular activity.\n\nPage 128 of 1019\n\n\fBlair School of Music is home to internationally known faculty soloists and ensembles, and Blair’s performers,\ncomposers, ethnomusicologists, and musicologists are among the most respected in their fields. Members of the\nfaculty ensembles provide private performance instruction and coach chamber music ensembles and performance\nclasses. The faculty's dedication to teaching and a low student/faculty ratio provide students the personal attention\nthat fosters maximum musical growth and understanding. The school is committed to its goal of developing students\nwho are among the most articulate, culturally aware, and artistically sensitive of any graduates in the country.\n\nFacilities\nThe Blair building incorporates innovative developments in acoustical design and engineering. It contains teaching\nstudios and faculty offices, classrooms, rehearsal halls, practice rooms, library, administrative offices, technology\nand keyboard labs, and concert venues. The 272-seat Steve and Judy Turner Recital Hall is the locus for student\nrecitals and concerts and master classes by faculty members and visiting artists held on a regular basis. It also\nhouses the Dobson Organ Opus 92 (2014), designed in the tradition of eighteenth-century eastern German organs\nnot unlike those Bach knew, with additions and accommodations for twenty-first century use. Opened in spring\n2002, the 609-seat Ingram Hall garnered immediate acclaim for its superb acoustics, its visual beauty, and its\nenhancement of the school’s ability to host and produce orchestra, opera, and other major concert events.\n\nThe Anne Potter Wilson Music Library is a division of the Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries. The collection, begun\nin 1947, was moved from Peabody College to its new and permanent home at Blair in the summer of 1985. Named\nto honor Anne Potter Wilson by the Vanderbilt Board of Trust in 1987, the 12,000-square-foot library holds more\nthan 116,000 books, scores, sound and video recordings, and subscriptions to journals and online music databases.\nIt is equipped with a seminar room, listening and viewing stations, computer workstations, and study facilities. A\nvariety of equipment is available for check out including laptops, microphones, phone chargers, midi keyboards,\nheadphones, and umbrellas. Music librarians and staff are available to assist users with music research and finding\nresources for performance, study, or instruction.\n\nThe Blair Concert Series\nThe Blair Concert Series offers a broad array of music performances to the university community and the region.\nNational and international artists and ensembles, the Blair faculty, including resident ensembles and soloists, and\nstudent ensembles and performers are all featured. All student recitals are open to the public. More than 350\nconcerts are presented at the school each year, and most are free of charge, as a gift to the community.\n\nA milestone in the Blair School's history was “The Blair Commissions: Music for the 21st Century,” a project funded\nby the James Stephen Turner Family Charitable Foundation, which has commissioned several important works by\nrenowned composers from 2005 through 2019. These include works by Susan Botti and Peter Schickele and four\nmajor works by Michael Hersch. Each composition received its premiere in Nashville, and all the works were then\neither recorded or performed in New York. The project has served two intertwined missions: to promote the\ncomposition of outstanding works by the world’s leading composers and to invite attention to the excellent\nensembles and faculty performers of Vanderbilt University.\n\nComposers-in-residence who have visited the Blair School include Robert Beaser, William Bolcom, Susan Botti,\nGeorge Crumb, Michael Daugherty, Lukas Foss, Gabriela Lena Frank, John Harbison, Michael Hersch, Karel Husa,\nSteven Mackey, Donald Martino, Cindy McTee, Jessie Montgomery, Kevin Puts, Christopher Rouse, Adam\nSchoenberg, Joseph Schwantner, Frank Ticheli, Michael Torke, and Joan Tower.\n\nBlair Academy at Vanderbilt\nIndividual, group, class, and ensemble instruction for precollege and adult students (defined as students above high\nschool age not receiving university credit) is offered through the Blair Academy at Vanderbilt. Course offerings are\navailable at blair.vanderbilt.edu/blair-academy/.\n\nPage 129 of 1019\n\n\fClasses for Students in Other Vanderbilt Schools and Colleges\nEnsembles\nPerformance\nGroup Performance Instruction: Non-Major\nIndividual Performance Instruction\nMusic Minors\nMusic Minor\nMusicology/Ethnomusicology Minor\nMusic Composition Minor\nMusic Performance Minor\nMusic as a Second Major\nMusic Major (Second Major)\n\nThe Blair School of Music welcomes all Vanderbilt students into its classes and studios. A large number of courses\nare designed specifically for non-majors. Many classes are held in Sarratt Cinema, Alumni Hall, and other central\ncampus locations. Non-majors may also participate in any and all music major courses for which they are qualified.\n\nA wide variety of music courses fulfill liberal arts core requirements for undergraduates in the College of Arts and\nScience, the School of Engineering, and Peabody College. Students in the School of Engineering can count up to 12\nhours of MUSE, MUSO, COMP, MREP, MUTH, and performance courses, except MUSO 1001, towards liberal arts core\nrequirements. How students in the College of Arts and Science and Peabody College may use music courses varies\naccording to their specific degree and program requirements.\n\nEnsembles\nThe Blair School of Music sponsors several major performing ensembles, including the Vanderbilt University Singers,\nVanderbilt Chorale, Orchestra, Wind Symphony, Opera Theatre, and Blair Big Band. Other non-western and\nvernacular ensembles, such as the African Performing Ensemble and the Steel Drum/Pan Ensemble, are also\navailable for credit. A large number of smaller ensembles and chamber music groups also exist, offering students a\nwide variety of experiences.\n\nAuditions. Auditions for the major performing ensembles are held at the beginning of each semester. Audition\ninformation can be found on the Blair School of Music website. Assignment is at the discretion of the director.\nStudents need the approval of the appropriate faculty chamber music coordinator before enrolling in chamber\nmusic; if participation has not been discussed with the coach, students may register tentatively for the “to be\nassigned” section of chamber music. Openings in ensemble are not guaranteed.\n\nCredit. Students may register for course credit. Audit status or registration for zero hours may be possible with\npermission of the director and the associate dean of the student's school or college.\n\nPage 130 of 1019\n\n\fPerformance\nPerformance instruction in individual or group settings is available for university credit for an additional fee.

The small-group nature of these seminars allows for direct student-faculty interaction that stresses\ntraining in techniques of scholarly inquiry. The students’ written work and oral presentations are subject to\nthoughtful critical review by the faculty member, providing feedback that can be used to reconsider the manner in\nwhich they articulate their ideas and to refine their skills in these areas. Thus, first-year students learn not only\nabout the subject matter of the seminar, but are also exposed to new methods of acquiring knowledge, different\nways of expressing and sharing ideas, and unique opportunities to participate in critical inquiry.\n\nAll first-year students must enroll in a First-Year Writing Seminar. (First-Year Writing Seminars in the College of Arts\nand Science are numbered 1111.) This course may be taken during the fall or the spring semester. Students are\npermitted to enroll in only one First-Year Writing Seminar per semester. All First-Year Writing Seminars also count in\ntheir appropriate distribution areas within the Liberal Arts Requirement, but a second seminar will not count toward\nthe writing requirement. Students who transfer into the College of Arts and Science (whether from another school at\nVanderbilt or from another college or university) do not complete a First-Year Writing Seminar. Students beyond\ntheir second semester in residence may not register for First-Year Writing Seminars, nor may First- Year Writing\nSeminars be repeated after completion of the second semester in residence.\n\nThe Writing Requirement\nExcellent communication skills, including the ability to articulate ideas and defend positions in writing, will be\nparamount for the 21st-century graduates of Vanderbilt University; therefore, all students in the College of Arts and\nScience must successfully complete the Writing Requirement.",

These courses introduce\nstudents to the principles and practices of public discourse and reasoned argument. Attention to the process\nof effective oral communication is integral to these classes. Students receive regular speaking assignments\nthroughout the semester and regular feedback to enhance effective speaking skills. All students must\ncomplete Part d of the Writing Requirement before graduation.\n\nThe Liberal Arts Requirement\nThe Liberal Arts Requirement consists of successful completion of thirteen courses from the College of Arts and\nScience. Most courses in the College of Arts and Science fulfill one of these Liberal Arts requirements. Courses must\ncarry three or more credits to count toward the AXLE Liberal Arts Requirement. Although some courses may be\nappropriate to more than one requirement, each course will fulfill only one requirement. These thirteen courses\nmust be distributed as outlined below.

Students may satisfy this requirement by choosing courses that focus on the history and culture of a\nsingle society or time period in human history and/or that represent a broad spectrum of different human societies\nand time periods.\nLanguage courses introduce students to the language of a different culture and provide insight into that culture in\nways that are not possible to achieve through detached study. At intermediate and advanced levels, students are\nable to explore the culture in depth, using the language itself to read, discuss, and write about its various aspects.\nEven at the most basic level, exposure to the language of a different culture prepares students to think and act in\nterms of living in a global community.\n\nIntermediate and advanced language courses prepare students for study abroad programs, which the College of\nArts and Science strongly recommends. A maximum of one course in this requirement may be satisfied through\nstudy abroad in a Vanderbilt-approved program. A summer study abroad program must earn 6 or more credit hours\nto satisfy this requirement.\n\nThe Global Education Office maintains a list of pre-approved programs.\n\nNote: All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt’s international security\nprovider. Registration is completed on your behalf if you enroll in a program offered through the Global Education\nOffice. Otherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.\n\nPage 107 of 1019\n\n\fAll students must complete three courses in this category, irrespective of previous language study or proficiency in\na language other than English.

Students may demonstrate proficiency in a number of ways: SAT\nSubject Test scores (French, 540; German, 470; Hebrew, 530; Italian, 540; Japanese with Listening, 440; Latin, 530;\nSpanish, 520); by appropriate score on proficiency tests (written and oral) administered by the Tennessee Language\nCenter; or with AP or IB credit in a foreign language. The first semester of an introductory language acquisition class\nin any language a student has studied for at least two years in high school, or in which a student transfers credit\nfrom another institution, cannot be used in partial fulfillment of this requirement. Intensive elementary language\ncourses that cover the content of two semesters in one shall count as one course toward this category.\n\nStudents who, because of special ability and achievement, are admitted to the College of Arts and Science without\nthe normally required two years of one foreign language in high school must enroll in a foreign language course\nduring their first semester and must remain continuously enrolled until they successfully complete a full year of one\nforeign language.

The methods employed by social scientists are correspondingly broad, involving\napproaches as varied as mapping brain activity, discovering and charting ancient cultures, identifying the societal\nforces that shape individual and group behavior, and using mathematics to understand economic phenomena. By\nstudying how humans and societies function, students will learn about individual and societal diversity, growth, and\nchange.\n\nPage 108 of 1019\n\n\ff. Perspectives — P (1 course)\nCourses in Perspectives give significant attention to individual and cultural diversity, multicultural interactions,\nsexual orientation, gender, racial, ethical, and religious issues within a culture across time or between cultures,\nthereby extending the principles and methods associated with the liberal arts to the broader circumstances in which\nstudents live. These courses emphasize the relationship of divergent ethics and moral values to contemporary social\nissues and global conflicts.\n\nThe Major\nAll students must successfully complete a course of study leading to one of the approved major programs in the\nCollege of Arts and Science, or successfully complete an individually designed interdisciplinary major designed in\nconsultation with College of Arts and Science faculty and approved by the Committee on Individual Programs in the\nCollege of Arts and Science.\n\nAXLE Curriculum Course Distribution\nThe distribution of Arts and Science courses into AXLE categories is available in YES. Using the advanced-classsearch dialog box, use the pull-down menu under “Class Attributes” to select an AXLE category.\n\nAXLE, the Major, and the Optional Minor\nCourses used to satisfy requirements of AXLE may also be used to satisfy requirements of the major or the optional\nminor.\n\nAdvanced Placement under AXLE\nWith the exception of basic English composition and the foreign language proficiency requirements, no AXLE\nrequirement may be fulfilled with any form of advanced placement credit (AP, IB, A-level, etc.).\n\nTransfer Credit under AXLE\nGenerally, only courses taken in the College of Arts and Science may be used toward AXLE; however, any college\ncourse credit earned prior to graduation from high school, and transfer credit earned before admission to\nVanderbilt, may be used toward fulfilling AXLE requirements.\n\nArea of Concentration\nDuring the junior and senior years, much of the student’s work is concentrated in one large unit of intellectually\nrelated courses. The program of concentration may be arranged through a single major, an interdisciplinary major,\nor a double major. Each of the three options is described below. A triple major may be declared with the approval of\nthe Administrative Committee.\n\nMajor Field\nUnder this plan, the student majors in one of the recognized fields. There shall not be fewer than 27 credit hours in\nthe major field, but a given department may require up to 48 credit hours. Students may take more than the\nrequired number of credit hours in any major; any given department, however, may limit the total permissible credit\n\nPage 109 of 1019\n\n\fhours in a discipline.\n\nFor graduation, a student must have achieved a grade point average of at least 2.000 in all classes taken in the\nmajor. This set of courses includes all courses a student takes in the department or program of the major and all\ncourses a student takes outside the department or program that may count toward the major. All courses that are\nlisted as fulfilling credit hours required for the major, as listed in the Undergraduate Catalog, are included in\ncalculating the grade point average in the major.\n\nWithin the framework of these general requirements, each department has its own policies governing major work,\nwhich are published elsewhere in this catalog or otherwise available to students.\n\nAcademic programs of the College of Arts and Science are varied and broad in scope, with departmental majors\noffered in the following fields:\n\nAfrican American and Diaspora Studies\nAnthropology\nArchitecture and the Built Environment\nArt\nAsian Studies\nBiological Sciences\nChemistry\nCinema and Media Arts\nCommunication Studies\nEarth and Environmental Sciences\nEcology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology\nEconomics\nEnglish\nEnvironmental Sociology\nFrench\nGender and Sexuality Studies\nGerman Studies\n\nHistory\nHistory of Art and Architecture\nJewish Studies\nLaw, History, and Society\nMathematics\nMedicine, Health, and Society\nMolecular and Cellular Biology\nPhilosophy\nPhysics\nPolitical Science\nPsychology\nReligious Studies\nRussian Studies\nSociology\nSpanish\nSpanish and Portuguese\nTheatre\n\nDefined Interdisciplinary Programs\nStudents may also major in defined interdisciplinary programs (listed below). There shall not be fewer than 27 credit\nhours in the major field, but a given program may require up to 48 credit hours. The student must achieve at least a\n2.000 grade point average in all work taken in the major.\n\nAmerican Studies\nBiochemistry and Chemical Biology\nClassical and Mediterranean Studies\nCommunication of Science and Technology\nEconomics and History\nEuropean Studies\nEuropean Studies: Russia and Eastern Europe\nFrench and European Studies\n\nGerman and European Studies\nItalian and European Studies\nLatin American Studies\nLatino and Latina Studies\nNeuroscience\nPublic Policy Studies\nSpanish and European Studies\n\nPage 110 of 1019\n\n\fStudents may combine an interdisciplinary major with a major in one of the recognized fields listed at the beginning\nof this section.\n\nDeclaration of the Area of Concentration\nStudents may formally declare a major at any time during the third semester of residence and must do so no later\nthan the Friday before Spring Break of the fourth semester. The student selects a department or interdisciplinary\nprogram and contacts that department or program for assignment to an adviser. Students who wish to develop an\nindividually designed interdisciplinary program apply to the associate dean who chairs the Committee on Individual\nPrograms.\n\nEach fall a program is arranged that provides for consultation of sophomores with department chairs, for the\npurpose of helping students select a major. Sophomore students who have not declared a major should participate\nin this program if they intend to attain junior standing before the next spring.\n\nStudents should declare their intention to pursue specific majors by completing forms available in the Dean’s Office\nof Undergraduate Education as well as the various departmental and program offices. Departments and programs\nassign advisers to students who declare majors in their respective areas. Students have the responsibility to know\nand satisfy all requirements for majors that they intend to complete. When the student’s major has been registered,\naccess to the student’s academic record is transferred from the pre-major adviser to the new major adviser, with\nwhom they should work closely.\n\nStudents may not add a major(s) past the fifth class-day of the first semester of the senior year.\n\nIndividually Designed Interdisciplinary Majors\nThis plan permits students to contract for an individually designed program of concentration consisting of at least\n48 credit hours of approved work. The program is constructed around a coherent academic purpose and may draw\ntogether the academic resources of a number of departments and schools. The program’s purpose may include\ntopical, period, or area studies, and must be consistent with the philosophy underlying a liberal arts education (see\nthe “What is Liberal Education?” section of this catalog). The program should not be designed with a focus on preprofessional training (e.g., pre-business, pre-law, or pre-medicine). The student may be required to achieve a\nstandard of proficiency in appropriately related areas such as foreign languages or mathematics in addition to the\n48 credit hours constituting the program of concentration.\n\nEach student must identify a major adviser who will offer advice and guidance. The major adviser must be a\nprofessor or full-time senior lecturer in the College of Arts and Science.\n\nThe student’s plan for an individually designed interdisciplinary major is a statement of required courses.\nFurthermore, because of the nature of interdisciplinary majors, all courses that have previously been included in the\nstudent’s plan are considered to be part of the major discipline. The student must achieve at least a 2.000 grade\npoint average in all courses that are (or have been) part of the plan.\n\nNormally, no more than three introductory-level courses will be counted toward the interdisciplinary major.\n\nStudents may not add a major(s) past the fifth class day of the first semester of the senior year.\n\nPage 111 of 1019\n\n\fDouble and Triple Majors\nThis program permits a student to concentrate in two or three fields, which may or may not be intellectually related.\nWith approval of the departments concerned, the student completes all of the requirements stipulated for the\nmajors. Triple majors require approval of the Administrative Committee.\n\nEach A&S major must include at least 24 credit hours that are being counted solely toward the major. This rule also\napplies to students who combine (in a double or triple major) a non-interdisciplinary major with an interdisciplinary\nmajor.\nStudents in the School of Engineering may use courses taken in the College of Arts & Science for relevant second\nmajors even if those courses also fulfill a School of Engineering degree requirement.\nApproved Second Majors Outside the College\nAll undergraduate courses, majors, and minors offered by Blair School of Music, School of Engineering, and Peabody\nCollege are approved for students in the College of Arts and Science. See the appropriate sections of the\nUndergraduate Catalog under each school for details. Arts and Science students with a second major from another\nVanderbilt undergraduate school must earn a minimum of 90 credit hours in Arts and Science. Consultation with the\nstudent’s Arts and Science major adviser is especially important.\n\nAdditional Programs in the College of Arts and Science\nThe Optional Minor\nUndergraduate Research\nStudy Abroad Programs\nPre-Professional Studies\nMedicine\nDentistry\nNursing\nArchitecture\nEngineering\nLaw\nTeacher Education\nInternships\nFinding an Internship\nInterdisciplinary Internships\nDepartmental Internships\nCost of an Internship\nCombined B.A./M.A. (4+1) Program\nPrograms of Study\nAdmissions Overview\nAdvising\n\nPage 112 of 1019\n\n\fCurriculum\nScholarships and Financial Aid\n\nFor information on the College Scholars program and departmental honors, please see the section titled Honors.\n\nThe Optional Minor\nA minor is a program within a recognized area of knowledge offering students more than a casual introduction to the\narea but less than a major in it. Although the completion of a minor is not a degree requirement, students may elect\nto complete the courses specified for one or more minors. A student who completes all designated courses in a\nminor with a grade point average of at least 2.000 will have the minor entered on the transcript at the time of\ngraduation.\n\nMinors may be combined with any departmental major or interdisciplinary major, but minors may not be earned in\nthe department or program of the major. Each minor must, however, include at least 15 credit hours that are being\ncounted solely toward the minor. Courses may not be taken on a P/F basis if they are offered in the department of\nthe minor or if they are being counted toward an interdisciplinary minor (see Academic Regulations).\n\nMinors consist of a minimum of five courses of 3 or more credit hours each. Many minors require a greater number\nof credit hours and specific courses. When a minor is offered in a discipline that offers a major, only those courses\nthat count toward the major may be counted toward the minor.\n\nStudents should refer to the appropriate sections of this catalog for specific requirements. Minors available at\npresent are listed below.\n\nStudents should declare their intention to pursue specific minors by completing forms available in the Dean’s Office\nof Undergraduate Education as well as the various departmental and program offices. Departments and programs\nassign advisers to students who declare minors in their respective areas. Students have the responsibility to know\nand satisfy all requirements for minors that they intend to complete.\n\nStudents may not add or change a minor after the final day of classes in the second semester of their senior year.\n\nOptional minors are offered in the following fields and interdisciplinary programs:\n\nPage 113 of 1019\n\n\fAfrican American and Diaspora\nStudies\nAmerican Studies\nAnthropology\nArabic Language\nArchitecture and the Built\nEnvironment\nArt\nAsian Studies\nAstronomy\n\nEnglish\nEnvironmental and Sustainability\nStudies\nEuropean Studies\nFrench\n\nMediterranean Studies\nNanoscience and Nanotechnology**\nNeuroscience\nPhilosophy\n\nGender and Sexuality Studies\n\nPhysics\n\nGerman Studies\nHistory\nHistory of Architecture\n\nBiological Sciences\n\nIslamic Studies\n\nBrazilian Studies\nChemistry\nChinese Language and Culture\nCinema and Media Arts\nCommunication of Science and\nTechnology\nCommunication Studies\nData Science*\nEarth and Environmental Sciences\n\nItalian Studies\nJapanese Language and Culture\nJewish Studies\nKorean Language and Culture\n\nPolitical Science\nPortuguese\nPsychology\nQuantum Information Science and\nEngineering\nReligious Studies\nRussian Studies\nScientific Computing**\nSociology\n\nLatin American Studies\n\nSouth Asian Language and Culture\n\nLatino and Latina Studies\nMathematics\nMedicine, Health, and Society\n\nSpanish\nSports and Society\nTheatre\n\nEconomics\n\nMediterranean Archaeology\n\nUndergraduate Business Minor ^\n\n* Administered by the four undergraduate schools\n**Administered by the School of Engineering in collaboration with the College of Arts and Science\n^Administered by the four undergraduate schools and the Owen Graduate School of Management\n\nApproved Minors Outside the College\n\nArts and Science students are permitted to pursue a second major and/or a minor that has been approved by the\nfaculties of the other Vanderbilt undergraduate schools: the Blair School of Music, the School of Engineering, and\nPeabody College of Education and Human Development. See the appropriate sections of the Undergraduate Catalog\nunder each school for details. Minors may not be earned in the department or program of the major.\n\nUndergraduate Research\nAll students have ample opportunity to participate in faculty research projects or to pursue research projects\nindependently, both on campus and at remote sites. Such research has led to the publication of coauthored or\nstudent-authored papers and other presentations to the scholarly community. Summer and academic year research\nby undergraduates in all fields may be subsidized by the university or the College of Arts and Science. Students\nshould contact the director of undergraduate studies in the field of interest for more information.\n\nStudy Abroad Programs\nVanderbilt offers study programs for all undergraduate students from Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, School\nof Engineering, and Peabody College to provide undergraduates immediate contact with cultures different from their\nown and to aid in the mastery of foreign languages. Students interested in applying for study abroad should consult\ntheir advisers to determine whether all degree requirements can be completed on schedule.\n\nPage 114 of 1019\n\n\fBrochures on all approved programs are available in the Global Education Office in Room 115, Student Life Center.\nGEO also maintains a website, vanderbilt.edu/geo. The study abroad programs are described in more detail in the\nSpecial Programs for Undergraduates section of this catalog.\n\nWhen choosing programs in a city for study abroad, College of Arts and Science students may only apply to the\nVanderbilt-approved overseas program(s). The College only accepts credit from international schools and programs\nthat have been approved by Vanderbilt faculty, and for which the University has a contract or agreement.\n\nPre-Professional Studies\nMedicine\nStudents interested in the study of medicine should plan their undergraduate programs in consultation with Dr.\nMichelle Grundy, health professions adviser. There is no formal premedical program of courses in the College of Arts\nand Science or elsewhere at Vanderbilt. Each student should plan a program to meet individual needs. The program\nshould include whatever courses may be necessary to meet medical school admission requirements, all courses\nrequired for the major, all AXLE requirements, and elective options. Students may choose majors from any of the\nfour undergraduate colleges, and may elect to pursue a double major or an interdisciplinary program of\nconcentration.\n\nA student who plans to apply for admission to the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, as well as other medical\nschools, may choose either of the following options:\n\n1. A student may qualify for admission with a B.A. degree, whether completed in three years or in four. Minimum\nrequirements for admission generally would be met by completing at least two semesters of English, four semesters\nof chemistry including organic, two semesters of biology, two semesters of physics, and at least one semester of\ncalculus/math. Since prerequisites may vary across medical schools, students are urged to consult the online\nresource, Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR) published by the American Association of Medical Schools\n(at aamc.org) for school-specific information.\n\nIn light of the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) changes that took effect in 2015, it is recommended that\nstudents take one semester of biochemistry and one semester of introductory statistics. Additionally, through course\nwork or self-directed study, students will need to be knowledgeable in basic concepts of psychology, sociology, and\nbioethics.\n\nFor more information, students are advised to visit the website of the Health Professions Advisory Office\n(vanderbilt.edu/hpao) and refer to the links for 1) “Premedical Preparation” and 2) “Threading a path through\npremedical expectations.”\n\n2. A student may qualify as a three-year student in the senior-in-absentia program (see Senior-in-Absentia in this\ncatalog).\n\nDentistry\nStudents interested in predental studies should plan their undergraduate program in consultation with Dr. Michelle\nGrundy, health professions adviser. There is no formal predental program of courses at Vanderbilt. Predental studies\nshould include courses necessary to meet dental school admission requirements, all courses required for the major,\nall AXLE requirements, and elective options. Students may choose majors from any of the four undergraduate\ncolleges. They may also elect a double major or an interdisciplinary program of concentration. A student may apply\n\nPage 115 of 1019\n\n\fto dental school under the senior-in-absentia program (see Senior-in-Absentia in this catalog) or apply for admission\nafter three years of college work without a degree.\n\nAny student contemplating application to dental school should take at least two semesters of English, four\nsemesters of chemistry including organic, two semesters of biology, two semesters of physics, and at least one\nsemester of calculus/math. Since prerequisites may vary across dental schools, students are urged to consult the\nADEA Official Guide to Dental Schools published by the American Association of Dental Schools.\n\nNursing\nStudents interested in developing a program that could lead to a master of science in nursing are advised to consult\nthe Office of Admissions in the School of Nursing.\n\nArchitecture\nUndergraduate students in the College of Arts and Science expecting to pursue architecture at the graduate level\nshould complete at least one year of analytic geometry and calculus and one year of physics. Students may select\nany major but would want to include courses that emphasize a broad sense of art and architectural history,\nincluding courses in studio art. Before applying to specific schools of architecture, they would develop a portfolio of\ncreative work. Further information is available from the pre-architecture advisers: Professor Vesna Pavlović,\nDepartment of Art, and Professor Kevin Murphy, Department of the History of Art and Architecture.\n\nEngineering\nUndergraduate students in the College of Arts and Science expecting to pursue engineering at the graduate level\nshould normally major in a natural science or mathematics and, at a minimum, should complete two years of\ncalculus or its equivalent, one year each of chemistry and physics, and at least an additional year of a natural\nscience or mathematics. A minimum of one year of computer science is highly desirable. Students should seek\nspecific information concerning admission from the engineering school of their choice as early as possible,\npreferably by the end of the sophomore year, to assure optimum preparation for entry into that school. Standards\nfor admission vary, but usually a 3.00 average or better is required.\n\nLaw\nThere is no formal program of prelaw studies at Vanderbilt. Most law schools have no specific requirements for a\nprelaw curriculum but place great emphasis on the development of the student’s ability to read and comprehend\naccurately, thoroughly, and rapidly; to speak and write clearly and correctly; to think precisely; and to analyze\ncomplex situations and weigh and appraise their several elements. The development of analytical skills and of\nmature study habits is vital. A broad cultural background is important—since law touches life at every point, every\nsubject in the college curriculum may bear on the lawyer’s work. Students interested in the study of law should plan\ntheir undergraduate programs in consultation with Dean Carrie Russell, prelaw adviser, in the Dean’s Office of\nUndergraduate Education.\n\nTeacher Education\nDetails will be found in Licensure for Teaching in the Peabody College section of this catalog.\n\nInternships\nStudents may earn academic credit for the work of internships in the College of Arts and Science on a Pass/Fail basis\n\nPage 116 of 1019\n\n\fthrough interdisciplinary or departmental internships. Credit hours earned will not count toward major or minor\nrequirements or toward AXLE, but will count as part of the total credit hours required for graduation. Students obtain\ntheir own placement and faculty adviser who works with them to develop a list of readings or research agenda for\nthe internship, which must be approved by the director of internships in the College of Arts and Science (Associate\nDean Daniel Morgan). The necessary forms for earning academic credit for an internship may be obtained from the\nDean’s Office of Undergraduate Education in 350 Buttrick Hall, although students register for internships through\ntheir respective school. The deadline for submitting registration forms to the office of Dean Jones for internship\ncourses taken during summer term and fall semester is May 1. Students expecting to intern during the spring\nsemester should submit registration forms by January 1.\n\nFinding an Internship\nStudents searching for an internship opportunity locally or elsewhere should contact the Career Center.\n\nInterdisciplinary Internships\nINDS 3880 (fall, spring), 3884 (summer). 1 credit hour (repeatable)\n\nAny student who is at least a sophomore and in good academic standing may earn one credit hour per semester or\nsummer for an internship under this designation. This course may be repeated twice for a maximum of 3 credit\nhours exclusively on a Pass/Fail basis.\n\nDepartmental Internships\nMaximum of 15 credit hours (may be taken only once)\n\nUnder this option students from any discipline may earn academic credit for internships in the departments listed\nbelow if they meet the minimum GPA requirements and have 6 credit hours of prior work in the department in which\nthey wish to intern. Students are responsible for securing a faculty adviser for the internship and developing an\nacademic plan of work for the internship opportunity, both of which must be approved by the director of\nundergraduate studies in the department in which the internship is housed. (In some instances, the DUS will serve\nas the faculty adviser for all internships taken in that discipline.) All internships under this designation are taken\nconcurrently with a research and/or readings course. The latter is taken on a graded basis and may count toward\nrequirements for a major or minor. Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies in the department\nof interest to obtain additional information about internships in that discipline. The following departments offer up to\n15 credit hours of academic credit per semester or summer for the following courses (internship courses are offered\nduring FALL, SPRING, and SUMMER sessions):\n\nAADS 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3–6].\nAMER 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–6], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3–6].\nANTH 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1–6].\nBCB 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1–6].\nCLAS 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1–6].\nCMA 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1–6].\nEES 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3–6].\nFREN 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training in France [1], 3881: Internship Readings and Research in France [3].\nGSS (formerly WGS) 3880, 3882–3883. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3882: Internship Readings [1–3], 3883:\n\nPage 117 of 1019\n\n\fInternship Research [1–3].\nHART 3880, 3883. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3883: Internship Research [1–3].\nHIST 3880, 3882–3883. 3880: Internship Training [3–9], 3882: Internship Readings [3], 3883: Internship Research\n[3].\nJS 3880, 3883. 3880: Internship Training [1–3], 3883: Internship Research [3].\nLAS 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3-6].\nMHS 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1–6].\nPSCI 3880, 3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1-6].\nPSY 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3–6].\nRUSS 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3–6].\nSOC 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training [1–9], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3–6].\nSPAN 3880–3881. 3880: Internship Training in Spain [1], 3881: Internship Readings and Research in Spain [3].\n\nMore complete information regarding departmental internship courses may be found in the course descriptions in\nthis catalog.\n\nCost of an Internship\nInternships taken during the fall or spring semester will fall under the normal tuition charge unless the student falls\nbelow 12 or exceeds 18 credit hours during the semester. In both instances, the hourly tuition charge will apply with\npermission for an underload/overload from the appropriate academic dean. Students will be charged for internships\ntaken during summer on the basis of the hourly tuition rate for summer school unless approved in advance to\nreceive the internship subsidy (see the Career Center website).\n\nCombined B.A./M.A. (4+1) Program\nThe College of Arts and Science offers students in many departments and programs the opportunity to earn both the\nbachelor’s degree and the master’s degree in a shorter period of time and at less cost than is normally the case.\n\nExceptional students in the College of Arts and Science can obtain both degrees in an expedited period, typically\nwithin, but not less than, five years.\nThe usual period of study for both the bachelor’s and the master’s degree is six years. Through the 4+1 option, the\nstudent and her or his adviser plan a five-year program of study. It is important to note that there is no provision for\nobtaining both degrees in a period shorter than five years. The program is intended for selected students for whom\nthe master’s degree is sufficient preparation for their career goals, is desirable as a goal in itself, or is viewed as\nadditional preparation before pursuing a doctorate or a professional degree.\n\nThe areas of study available for the Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) option within Arts and Science are determined by\nindividual departments and programs, which also determine the policies and guidelines to be followed. Students will\nbe admitted to the Combined B.A./M.A. program only by the invitation and the approval of the department or\nprogram.\n\nPrograms of Study\n\nPage 118 of 1019\n\n\fThe 4+1 option is currently available in the following departments and programs: English; French; German; History;\nHistory of Art and Architecture; Latin American Studies; Mathematics; Medicine, Health, and Society; Philosophy;\nPolitical Science; and Psychology. Students are welcome to discuss the Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) option with any of\nthese departments and programs.\n\nAdmissions Overview\nThe Combined B.A./M.A program allows Vanderbilt University students to study for both degrees typically, but not\nnecessarily, in the same department. Undergraduates with strong academic records may apply for admission to the\nprogram after the first semester of their junior year. Qualifying students are normally accepted into the program in\nthe second semester of the junior year.\n\nTo apply for admission, students will first consult with the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education (350 Buttrick\nHall), and then submit to the prospective graduate department or program a “Petition to Apply to the Combined\nB.A./M.A. (4+1) Degree Program” (available at as.vanderbilt.edu/academics/specialdegree/4plus1.php), a statement\nof purpose, a formal application to the Graduate School, a preliminary program proposal, two letters of\nrecommendation from Vanderbilt faculty, and a current transcript. Application forms are available for download or\ncan be completed online at vanderbilt.edu/gradschool. GRE scores or other admissions requirements may be\nspecified by the prospective department. Admission to the 4+1 option is highly selective. An accomplished\nacademic record, a demonstrated commitment to pursue graduate study, and a strong endorsement from\nVanderbilt faculty are key elements to the successful applicant. Students will be provisionally accepted as graduate\nstudents, pending completion of all undergraduate requirements. Graduate student status will apply in the fifth\nyear.\n\nAdvising\nProspective students should discuss with one of their advisers general information on the program and whether this\nprogram is appropriate to their long-term goals. All students are encouraged to discuss their plans and goals with\ntheir undergraduate pre-major and major adviser. Especially in cases where the intended graduate program differs\nfrom the undergraduate major, the student is further encouraged to seek advice from the advisers in the graduate\nprogram.\n\nCurriculum\nStudents in a 4+1 program must satisfy all requirements for both degrees. Advanced Placement (AP) credits will\noften be used toward satisfying general curriculum requirements, for a maximum of 18 credit hours. The principal\ndistinction between this program and the standard graduate program is two-fold: (1) students are allowed to take\nmaster’s courses while completing the bachelor’s degree, and (2) students are thereby enabled to complete both\ndegrees within five years.\n\nIn order to complete the program in five years, students will be expected to complete most, if not all, of the\nrequirements for their undergraduate degree by the end of the first semester of the senior year. Until all\nbaccalaureate requirements are fulfilled, the student will follow College of Arts and Science undergraduate policies\nand procedures. It is also suggested that students begin taking graduate courses toward the master’s degree in the\nsecond semester of the senior year. Most graduate programs participating in this option have a non-thesis plan of\nstudy requiring 30 graduate credit hours in addition to the requirements for the undergraduate degree. An average\nload per semester as a graduate student is 9–12 credit hours.\n\nScholarships and Financial Aid\nStudents who are receiving scholarships or other forms of financial aid as a Vanderbilt undergraduate are advised\nthat such aid applies in most cases only toward the completion of the bachelor’s degree or the first four years of\ntheir studies (which may include their taking some graduate courses during their senior year). Students wishing to\n\nPage 119 of 1019\n\n\fpursue the 4+1 option should seek support for their fifth year of study through student loans and other financial aid.\n\nFor additional information, contact A&S Deans’ Office, 350 Buttrick Hall, or consult the website\nas.vanderbilt.edu/academics/specialdegree/4plus1.php .\n\nHonors in the College of Arts and Science\nFounder's Medal\nLatin Honors Designation\nCollege Scholars Program\nDepartmental Honors\nDean's List\nPhi Beta Kappa\nHonor Societies for First-Year Students\nOther Awards and Prizes\nFounder’s Medal\nThe Founder’s Medal, signifying first honors, was endowed by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt as one of his gifts to\nthe university. The recipient is named by the Dean after consideration of faculty recommendations and overall\nacademic achievements, as well as grade point averages of the year’s highest ranking summa cum laude graduates.\n\nLatin Honors Designation\nHonors noted on diplomas and published in the Commencement program are earned as follows:\n\nSumma Cum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the top 5 percent of the previous\nthree years’ Arts and Science graduating seniors.\nMagna Cum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the next 8 percent of the previous\nthree years’ Arts and Science graduating seniors.\nCum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the next 12 percent of the previous three\nyears’ Arts and Science graduating seniors.\n\nCollege Scholars Program\nThe College Scholars Program is the honors program for the College of Arts and Science. All first-year students in the\nCollege of Arts & Science are invited to apply at the end of their first semester. Students are selected to participate\nin the College Scholars program based on their academic record and achievements from their first semester on\ncampus. These students have the opportunity to pursue advanced scholarly work in honors seminars and enriched\ncourses or independent-studies projects. The College Scholars program is open only to Arts and Science students.\n\nCollege Scholars may achieve the designation “Honors in the College of Arts and Science” on their diplomas by\nacquiring fifteen “honors points” in the program. The honors points system encourages breadth and depth. Students\naccomplish these goals by taking honors seminars in several AXLE categories and by doing independent projects\n(independent studies, enriching courses, departmental honors research, internships, service, and creative projects).\nA maximum of thirteen points may be earned in honors seminars, and a minimum of two research projects must be\ncompleted to earn fifteen points. Students must earn a grade of “B” or better in classes that earn honors points. To\nremain in good standing in the program, students must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.000.\n\nPage 120 of 1019\n\n\fFurther information on the College Scholars program and honors in the College of Arts and Science may be obtained\nfrom Associate Dean Dan Morgan.\n\nDepartmental Honors\nTo encourage individual development and independent study within their field, many departments and\ninterdisciplinary programs of the College of Arts and Science offer honors programs for selected, superior\ncandidates. Students often begin departmental honors work in the junior year, but some projects start in the senior\nyear. To qualify for consideration, students must have (a) attained a minimum grade point average of 3.300 in all\nwork previously taken for credit and in the major, and (b) exhibited to the department(s) and/or interdisciplinary\nprogram(s) other evidence of the student’s capacity for independent study. Some departments and interdisciplinary\nprograms require higher grade point averages in all work previously taken for credit and/or in the major. Formal\nadmission is by the director of honors study in the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education after nomination by\nthe department(s) and/or interdisciplinary program(s) concerned.\n\nRequirements to complete departmental honors vary from department to department (see descriptions in the\nappropriate department sections of this catalog). Candidates are required to demonstrate some degree of originality\nand maturity in the methods of independent investigation, analysis, and criticism, and skill in the written\npresentation of independent work. This standard usually requires a senior thesis but may be satisfied, in\ndepartments that have gained approval of this procedure, by a series of briefer critical papers.\n\nDepartmental honors work culminates in an examination given in the second semester of the senior year. The\nexamination shall be both oral and written except in departments where honors students must take all courses\nrequired of standard majors in addition to those required of honors students. These departments have the option of\nmaking the examination either oral or both oral and written. The examination shall be conducted by a committee\nwith a majority of examiners who have not participated in the candidate’s honors work. Where feasible, examiners\nfrom other institutions may be included. The examination shall cover the thesis and specific fields of the\nindependent work and may, at the discretion of the department, include all of the major work. Successful candidates\nare awarded honors or highest honors in their field, and this designation appears on their diplomas.\n\nDean’s List\nThe Dean’s List recognizes outstanding academic performance in a semester. Students are named to the Dean’s List\nwhen they earn a grade point average of at least 3.500 while carrying 12 or more graded credit hours, with no\ntemporary or missing grades in any course (credit or non-credit), and no grade of F. A student must be in a degreegranting school.\n\nPhi Beta Kappa\nThe Alpha Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in the state of Tennessee honors scholarly attainments in the liberal arts and\nsciences and annually elects seniors and juniors to membership during the spring semester.\n\nSeniors who have completed at least 60 credit hours in the College of Arts and Science and earned a cumulative\ngrade point average of 3.65 or higher are eligible for consideration, as are juniors who have completed at least 70\ncredit hours at Vanderbilt with a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.90. Juniors must have completed most\nAXLE requirements by the end of their junior year. For calculating credit hours and judging residence requirements,\nthe chapter treats foreign study programs in the same manner as does the College of Arts and Science.\n\nAttainment of the minimum required grade point average does not guarantee election. Membership in Phi Beta\nKappa is based on a demonstration of scholarly achievements, broad cultural interests, and high moral character.\n\nPage 121 of 1019\n\n\fThe scholarly work must emphasize liberal rather than applied or professional studies. As a guideline, for seniors at\nleast 90 credit hours must qualify as liberal. Grades earned in applied (vocational) or professional course work are\nnot counted in computing the grade point average. The breadth of a candidate’s program, as shown by the number\nand variety of courses taken outside the major, is also considered.\n\nPhi Beta Kappa has long emphasized the importance of mathematics and foreign language in a liberal education. In\nkeeping with this tradition, the chapter considers only those students who have demonstrated proficiency in these\nareas beyond the AXLE graduation requirements. Proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking a foreign language is\ntypically demonstrated by passing a course in a language at a level at least one semester beyond the AXLE\nrequirements. Courses must be taken on a graded rather than a P/F basis. The foreign language requirement may\nbe satisfied with College Board SAT Subject, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or Tennessee\nLanguage Center test scores.\n\nMathematics proficiency may be demonstrated by completing two semesters of calculus or one semester of calculus\nand one semester of statistics. Courses must be taken on a graded rather than a P/F basis. The mathematics\nrequirement may be satisfied with Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A-Level exam credit, but\nnot College Board SAT Subject test scores.\n\nIn no event may the total number of persons elected from any senior class exceed 10 percent of the class, and from\nany junior class exceed six persons. Eligible juniors who are not elected are reconsidered for membership in their\nsenior year.\n\nRefer to the chapter website my.vanderbilt.edu/phibetakappa for additional information and detailed eligibility\ncriteria.\n\nHonor Societies for First-Year Students\nFirst-year students who earn a grade point average of 3.500 or better for their first semester are eligible for\nmembership in the Vanderbilt chapters of Phi Eta Sigma and Alpha Lambda Delta.\n\nOther Awards and Prizes\nMORRIS H. BERNSTEIN JR. PRIZE IN LATIN DECLAMATION. Established in 1983 by William H. Bernstein (B.A. 1983) in\nmemory of his father (B.A. 1943, M.D. 1946).

Graduates of the Blair School are recognized as superior artists and scholars distinguished by their global\nmindsets, broad interdisciplinary competencies, and unyielding commitments to advocacy, entrepreneurship, and\neducation.\n\nThe Blair School has been an integral part of Nashville’s musical environment since its founding in 1964 by the Justin\nand Valere Potter Foundation through a bequest of Valere Blair Potter. In 1981 the school was merged with\nVanderbilt following the university’s decision to develop an excellent program in music. Studies leading to the\nprofessional bachelor of music in performance were initiated in 1986.\n\nThe Bachelor of Music degree program includes majors in performance, composition, jazz studies, and integrated\nstudies. The performance major is available in any orchestral instrument, piano, saxophone, euphonium, and voice.\nThe major in composition emphasizes analytical skills as well as the development of students’ creativity. The jazz\nstudies major offers a focus on American and non-Western music traditions while also developing the core\nfundamentals of Western music common to all Blair majors. The integrated studies major combines the study of\ncomposition or a performance area with an additional concentration in music and forms the basis for a five-year\nprogram in teacher education offered cooperatively with Peabody College. In the Bachelor of Musical Arts degree\nprogram, composers and performers complete an in-depth music study in addition to a field outside of music.\n\nA non-professional 31-hour liberal arts music major makes it possible for students outside the Blair School to choose\nmusic as a second major. Students in other schools and colleges of the university also may pursue a minor in music,\nmusic composition, musicology/ethnomusicology, or music performance. And Blair offers a remarkable variety of\nelectives for students who wish to enrich their studies with credit in music courses, ensembles, or performance\ninstruction, or to select music as an extracurricular activity.\n\nPage 128 of 1019\n\n\fBlair School of Music is home to internationally known faculty soloists and ensembles, and Blair’s performers,\ncomposers, ethnomusicologists, and musicologists are among the most respected in their fields. Members of the\nfaculty ensembles provide private performance instruction and coach chamber music ensembles and performance\nclasses. The faculty's dedication to teaching and a low student/faculty ratio provide students the personal attention\nthat fosters maximum musical growth and understanding. The school is committed to its goal of developing students\nwho are among the most articulate, culturally aware, and artistically sensitive of any graduates in the country.\n\nFacilities\nThe Blair building incorporates innovative developments in acoustical design and engineering. It contains teaching\nstudios and faculty offices, classrooms, rehearsal halls, practice rooms, library, administrative offices, technology\nand keyboard labs, and concert venues. The 272-seat Steve and Judy Turner Recital Hall is the locus for student\nrecitals and concerts and master classes by faculty members and visiting artists held on a regular basis. It also\nhouses the Dobson Organ Opus 92 (2014), designed in the tradition of eighteenth-century eastern German organs\nnot unlike those Bach knew, with additions and accommodations for twenty-first century use. Opened in spring\n2002, the 609-seat Ingram Hall garnered immediate acclaim for its superb acoustics, its visual beauty, and its\nenhancement of the school’s ability to host and produce orchestra, opera, and other major concert events.\n\nThe Anne Potter Wilson Music Library is a division of the Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries. The collection, begun\nin 1947, was moved from Peabody College to its new and permanent home at Blair in the summer of 1985. Named\nto honor Anne Potter Wilson by the Vanderbilt Board of Trust in 1987, the 12,000-square-foot library holds more\nthan 116,000 books, scores, sound and video recordings, and subscriptions to journals and online music databases.\nIt is equipped with a seminar room, listening and viewing stations, computer workstations, and study facilities. A\nvariety of equipment is available for check out including laptops, microphones, phone chargers, midi keyboards,\nheadphones, and umbrellas. Music librarians and staff are available to assist users with music research and finding\nresources for performance, study, or instruction.\n\nThe Blair Concert Series\nThe Blair Concert Series offers a broad array of music performances to the university community and the region.\nNational and international artists and ensembles, the Blair faculty, including resident ensembles and soloists, and\nstudent ensembles and performers are all featured. All student recitals are open to the public. More than 350\nconcerts are presented at the school each year, and most are free of charge, as a gift to the community.\n\nA milestone in the Blair School's history was “The Blair Commissions: Music for the 21st Century,” a project funded\nby the James Stephen Turner Family Charitable Foundation, which has commissioned several important works by\nrenowned composers from 2005 through 2019. These include works by Susan Botti and Peter Schickele and four\nmajor works by Michael Hersch. Each composition received its premiere in Nashville, and all the works were then\neither recorded or performed in New York. The project has served two intertwined missions: to promote the\ncomposition of outstanding works by the world’s leading composers and to invite attention to the excellent\nensembles and faculty performers of Vanderbilt University.\n\nComposers-in-residence who have visited the Blair School include Robert Beaser, William Bolcom, Susan Botti,\nGeorge Crumb, Michael Daugherty, Lukas Foss, Gabriela Lena Frank, John Harbison, Michael Hersch, Karel Husa,\nSteven Mackey, Donald Martino, Cindy McTee, Jessie Montgomery, Kevin Puts, Christopher Rouse, Adam\nSchoenberg, Joseph Schwantner, Frank Ticheli, Michael Torke, and Joan Tower.\n\nBlair Academy at Vanderbilt\nIndividual, group, class, and ensemble instruction for precollege and adult students (defined as students above high\nschool age not receiving university credit) is offered through the Blair Academy at Vanderbilt. Course offerings are\navailable at blair.vanderbilt.edu/blair-academy/.\n\nPage 129 of 1019\n\n\fClasses for Students in Other Vanderbilt Schools and Colleges\nEnsembles\nPerformance\nGroup Performance Instruction: Non-Major\nIndividual Performance Instruction\nMusic Minors\nMusic Minor\nMusicology/Ethnomusicology Minor\nMusic Composition Minor\nMusic Performance Minor\nMusic as a Second Major\nMusic Major (Second Major)\n\nThe Blair School of Music welcomes all Vanderbilt students into its classes and studios.

How students in the College of Arts and Science and Peabody College may use music courses varies\naccording to their specific degree and program requirements.\n\nEnsembles\nThe Blair School of Music sponsors several major performing ensembles, including the Vanderbilt University Singers,\nVanderbilt Chorale, Orchestra, Wind Symphony, Opera Theatre, and Blair Big Band. Other non-western and\nvernacular ensembles, such as the African Performing Ensemble and the Steel Drum/Pan Ensemble, are also\navailable for credit. A large number of smaller ensembles and chamber music groups also exist, offering students a\nwide variety of experiences.\n\nAuditions. Auditions for the major performing ensembles are held at the beginning of each semester. Audition\ninformation can be found on the Blair School of Music website. Assignment is at the discretion of the director.\nStudents need the approval of the appropriate faculty chamber music coordinator before enrolling in chamber\nmusic; if participation has not been discussed with the coach, students may register tentatively for the “to be\nassigned” section of chamber music. Openings in ensemble are not guaranteed.\n\nCredit. Students may register for course credit. Audit status or registration for zero hours may be possible with\npermission of the director and the associate dean of the student's school or college.\n\nPage 130 of 1019\n\n\fPerformance\nPerformance instruction in individual or group settings is available for university credit for an additional fee.

By combining three and one-half years in Vanderbilt’s Blair School of Music with one and one-half\nyears of study in the Owen School, students may obtain both the bachelor of musical arts and the master of business\nadministration in five years. The baccalaureate from the Blair School is awarded at the end of the fourth year, and\nthe MBA from the Owen School after the fifth year. Students interested in pursuing this program must be enrolled in\nthe musical arts degree.\n\nRequired course work includes the normal Blair course work for the musical arts degree, for a minimum of 63 credit\nhours in music. The liberal arts core will also follow the requirements for the major, but must include the following\nspecific requirements:\n\nCalculus (1 semester)\nStatistics, e.g., ECON 1500: Economic Statistics\nECON 1010: Principles of Macroeconomics\nECON 1020: Principles of Microeconomics\nECON 3012: Microeconomics\n\nA curriculum plan, including recommended electives, is provided in the Blair Student Handbook.\n\nStudents must apply to the Owen School for admission to the five-year program during their junior year. Students\nshould apply in Round 1 of the MBA application cycle (typically early October) of the junior year, and early\napplication and a standardized test score (e.g., GMAT, GRE) are recommended. Acceptance into the five-year\nprogram is extremely competitive and requires advanced standing earned in undergraduate courses. Being deficient\n\nPage 163 of 1019\n\n\fin full-time work experience, the 3+2 student must enhance their portfolio with an internship and outstanding\nacademic performance, and also show a strong commitment to a rigorous business education. The Summer\nBusiness Institute (Accelerator), as administered by the Owen Graduate School of Management, is strongly\nrecommended for 3+2 applicants prior to matriculating at Owen. The successful applicant will bring an\naccomplished academic record (normally a GPA of 3.3 or better), satisfactory internship or work experience, an\nability to articulate his or her own preparedness for the work environment, and a strong endorsement from\nVanderbilt faculty.\n\nStudents who are accepted to the 3+2 program will remain registered as B.Mus.Arts students through fall of senior\nyear, and will register as Owen students in spring of senior year. Academically, students will take a full load of\nbusiness courses both in fall and spring of senior year while completing the final B.Mus.Arts degree requirements\n(normally, lessons and ensembles). Students must complete a minimum of 62 credit hours at Owen over four\nsemesters. Fifteen hours (normally in fall of the senior year) of Owen School courses approved by Blair may be\ncounted toward completion of the undergraduate degree. Students with questions may contact Liz Scowden\n(liz.scowden@vanderbilt.edu) in the Owen Academic and Student Affairs Office. The completion of the B.Mus.Arts\ndegree requirements prior to fall of the student’s fifth year is required for continuation in the MBA program.\n\nTuition and Financial Aid\nThe scholarship or other financial aid commitment of the Blair School will not be continued automatically beyond the\nseventh semester for students enrolled in the dual-degree program. Eighth-semester financial aid is the student’s\nresponsibility. Students should notify the Owen School with their application if they are interested in being a\ncandidate for an Owen scholarship during their MBA studies. Early application is recommended. Need-based aid will\nstill apply.\n\nStudents pay tuition to the undergraduate school for the fall semester of their fourth year, after which all tuition is\npaid to Owen (and reflects graduate school tuition rates). The Blair School of Music will waive fees for the required\nperformance instruction during spring of the fourth year to facilitate completion of the B.Mus.Arts requirements.\n\nHonors in the Blair School of Music\nFounder's Medal\nAcademic Honors Designation\nHonors Program in Musicology and Ethnomusicology\nDean's List\nPi Kappa Lambda\nAwards and Prizes\nFounder’s Medal\nThe Founder’s Medal, signifying first honors, was endowed by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt as one of his gifts to\nthe university.

Classes\noffering engineering instruction began in 1879, and seven years later Engineering was made a separate unit with its\n\nPage 170 of 1019\n\n\fown dean. The school’s program emphasizes the relationship of the engineering profession to society and prepares\nengineers to be socially aware as well as technically competent.\n\nThe mission of the School of Engineering is threefold: to produce intellectual leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators\nby recruiting the best students and providing them a top-notch education; to deliver scholarship of the highest\ncaliber, published in the most visible venues, addressing important societal problems; and to be a leader in\nentrepreneurship and innovation, in Tennessee, the U.S., and globally.\n\nThe school strives to meet the undergraduate education portion of its mission by offering degree programs in fields\nof engineering relevant to the needs of society. An objective of these programs is to provide a technical education\nintegrated with strong humanities, fine arts, and social sciences subject matter to provide the requisite foundation\nfor lifelong learning. The availability of second majors and minors in subject areas in other schools and colleges of\nthe university increases opportunities for engineering students to enhance their education by pursuing studies in\nthe non-technical disciplines. Engineering students take close to 50 percent of their courses outside of the School of\nEngineering and associate daily with peers from other schools and colleges within the university.\n\nAnother objective is to prepare students who intend to enter engineering practice upon graduation and those who\nwill continue their studies at the graduate level in engineering or in other professional fields. To this end, our\nprograms emphasize mathematics and engineering sciences with significant exposure to engineering design and\nhands-on laboratory experiences.\n\nA large fraction of the student body is destined for management positions early in their working careers. To meet\nthese students’ needs, the Engineering Management program offers a well-integrated minor.\n\nStudents at all levels have the opportunity to work with faculty in the generation of new knowledge. Those planning\nfor graduate studies and research are especially encouraged to participate in individual topics and research courses\nto fulfill that desire. Engineering students also participate in summer research programs of the university and of the\nschool.\n\nFacilities\nThe School of Engineering is housed in five main buildings with several satellite facilities. William W. Featheringill\nHall houses a three-story atrium designed for student interaction and social events, more than fifty teaching and\nresearch laboratories with the latest equipment and computer resources, and project rooms. The Engineering and\nScience Building is an eight-story state-of-the-art building that houses the Wond'ry at the Innovation Pavilion, the\nFrist Center for Autism and Innovation, numerous research labs, interactive classrooms, clean rooms, and space for\nstudents to work, study, and socialize. Olin Hall, which is attached to the Engineering and Science building, houses\nChemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Materials Science, several classrooms, and\nresearch and teaching laboratories. School administrative offices and several classrooms are located on the ground\nfloor of the Science and Engineering Building in Stevenson Center, which also houses the Biomedical Engineering\ndepartment on the 8th and 9th floors. Jacobs Hall, which flanks Featheringill Hall, contains laboratories, offices, and\nclassrooms serving the Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering departments.\nLabs, offices, and meeting spaces for Computer Science are also housed at 17th & DeFord Bailey, a building that\nserves as a hub for Computer Science and Data Science. Several satellite facilities are also part of the Engineering\nSchool: the W. M. Keck Free-Electron Laser Center building, housing the labs and offices of the Biomedical Photonics\nCenter; the Laboratory for Systems Integrity and Reliability (LASIR), an off-campus hangar-style facility dedicated to\nscaling up experiments to realistic and full size that houses a wind tunnel and military aircraft; the Vanderbilt\nInstitute of Software Integrated Systems; and the Institute for Space and Defense Electronics.\n\nIn all its engineering programs, Vanderbilt recognizes the vital place of experimental and research laboratories in\nthe learning experience. Laboratories are designed to provide the strongest personal contact between students and\nfaculty members consistent with enrollment.\n\nPage 171 of 1019\n\n\fWell-equipped undergraduate laboratories are maintained by the Chemistry and Physics & Astronomy departments\nin the College of Arts and Science, which offers mathematics and basic science courses required of all engineering\nstudents. Graduate and undergraduate divisions of these departments maintain teaching and research facilities in\nthe Stevenson Center for the Natural Sciences. Another supporting department, Biological Sciences, is housed in\nMedical Research Building III. Most classes in humanities and the social sciences are conducted in Buttrick, Calhoun,\nFurman, Garland, and Wilson halls.\n\nProfessional Registration and Accreditation\nLegislation exists in the various states requiring registration of all engineers who contract with the public to perform\nprofessional work. Although many engineering positions do not require professional certification, Vanderbilt\nsupports registration and encourages its graduates to take the Fundamentals of Engineering examination as soon as\nthey become eligible.\n\nBachelor of engineering degrees in biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical and\ncomputer engineering, and mechanical engineering are accredited as noted below. Students in these programs may\ntake the Fundamentals of Engineering examination as seniors. In addition, proven professional experience is a\nrequirement for registration. Some state boards may have additional requirements for licensure.\n\nAll programs leading to the Bachelor of Engineering degree and the program leading to the Bachelor of Science in\ncomputer science are accredited as follows:\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in biomedical engineering is accredited by the Engineering\nAccreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for\nBioengineering and Biomedical and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in civil engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation\nCommission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for Civil and\nSimilarly Named Engineering Programs.\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in chemical engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation\nCommission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for Chemical,\nBiochemical, Biomolecular and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.\n\nThe Bachelor of Science program in computer science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of\nABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and Program Criteria for Computer Science and Similarly\nNamed Computing Programs. The accredited program in computer science is the primary major administered by the\nSchool of Engineering. Computer science added as a second major by students outside the School of Engineering is\nnot an accredited program.\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in electrical and computer engineering is accredited by the\nEngineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program\nCriteria for Electrical, Computer, Communications, Telecommunication(s) and Similarly Named Engineering\nPrograms.\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in mechanical engineering is accredited by the the Engineering\nAccreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for\n\nPage 172 of 1019\n\n\fMechanical and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.\nEmployment of Graduates\nOf the recent Vanderbilt graduates with baccalaureate degrees in engineering, about 75 percent entered directly\ninto professional practice. Twenty-five percent continued with graduate or professional education. Others pursued\ndiverse careers or other interests. Additional information regarding the employment of engineering graduates is\navailable on the School of Engineering's website and in the VU Career Center.\nSupporting Organizations\n\nVanderbilt Engineering Council\nThe Engineering Council is a student organization whose main goal is facilitating community among undergraduate\nstudents in the School of Engineering by organizing activities, e.g., Engineering Week, de-stress events around final\nexaminations, and many more. Additionally, the council acts as a student voice to school administration and faculty.\nRepresentatives of engineering student organizations apply to serve on the E-Council leadership team, and the\ncurrent leadership board selects and trains the new members. While the council has no administrative power, it\nprovides students with a voice in the decision- making process in the School of Engineering.\n\nProfessional Societies\nThe leading national engineering societies have chartered branches or student sections at Vanderbilt. These\norganizations are run locally by students with the help of a faculty adviser. Meetings are devoted to matters of a\ntechnical nature, including outside speakers, plant trips, and other subjects of interest to the membership.\n\nStudents are invited to attend meetings and join as they will find the work of the professional societies beneficial in\norienting them in their careers.\n\nThe student professional societies are:\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n(A.I.A.A.)\nAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers (AICh.E)\nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers (A.S.C.E.)\nAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers (A.S.M.E)\nBiomedical Engineering Society\nEngineering World Health (E.W.H.)\nEngineers Without Borders (E.W.B.)\n\nInstitute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (I.E.E.E.)\nNational Society of Black Engineers (N.S.B.E.)\nSociety of Asian Scientists and Engineers (S.A.S.E.)\nSociety of Hispanic Professional Engineers (S.H.P.E.)\nSociety of Automotive Engineers (S.A.E.)\nSociety of Women Engineers (S.W.E.)\nWomen in Computing\n\nThe student Honor Societies are:\nTau Beta Pi\n\nAlpha Eta Mu Beta\n\nGraduating seniors may join the Order of the Engineer, a society that recognizes the commitment of its members to\nthe profession of engineering.\n\nIn addition to student chapters of national professional societies, the School of Engineering also hosts a number of\nadditional student organizations.\n\nDegree Programs in Engineering\nPage 173 of 1019\n\n\fDegree Programs in Engineering\nUndergraduate Degrees\nThe First Year\nMathematics and Physics\nLiberal Arts Core\nImmersion\nOpen Electives\nOfficer Education\nMaster of Engineering\nDigital Learning Programs\n\nBachelor of engineering degree programs are offered in the areas of biomedical, chemical, civil, electrical and\ncomputer, environmental, and mechanical engineering. Many of these programs allow considerable flexibility—but\nstudents are required to include in their courses of study those bodies of knowledge fundamental to that discipline.\n\nBachelor of science degree programs are offered in computer science and engineering science. The latter\ninterdisciplinary engineering discipline allows strong concentration in other areas of engineering or outside of the\nSchool of Engineering.\n\nThe school offers the master of engineering (M.Eng.), with emphasis on engineering design and practice, in most\nareas of study. The Graduate School, through departments of the School of Engineering, offers the research-oriented\nPh.D. and M.S. degrees in eight major fields.

While the\ncurriculum for the first year is generally the same for all students, there are important variations. For example, some\nmajor programs require a full year of introductory chemistry; others do not. Students should become familiar with\nrequirements of those programs in which they have an interest and confer with their adviser at the time of\nenrollment and throughout the first year to plan a program of study that will keep options open as long as possible.\n\nSpecimen curricula for the engineering programs are given in the Courses of Study section. Requirements for the\nB.E. and B.S. degrees for the various programs vary in the minimum amount of hours and in specific course\nrequirements in the basic sciences and in mathematics.\n\nIncluded in the first year for all majors is the course Engineering Science 1401–1403 Introduction to Engineering,\nwhich introduces the student to design tools used in all areas of engineering.\nMathematics and Physics\nEntering engineering students will be placed in the appropriate level mathematics course. Students having one full\nyear or more of high school credit in analytic geometry and calculus may qualify for advanced placement in a\nregular sequence by scoring well on the Advanced Placement Examination.\n\nStudents with high mathematical ability and achievement as demonstrated by testing credit or credit by\nexamination through the Department of Mathematics may begin in the next mathematics course for which they\nqualify (e.g., MATH 1301 or 2300). For more information, see the testing credit information under Advanced Credit in\nthe Admissions section of this catalog and course descriptions under Mathematics in the Arts and Science section of\nthis catalog. For majors requiring Math 2420 (Methods of Ordinary Differential Equations), students may select Math\n2400 (Differential Equations with Linear Algebra) or Math 2610 (Ordinary Differential Equations) as a substitute.\n\nFirst-year students with a test score of 5 on the Calculus-BC Advanced Placement examination and who wish to\npursue the honors track of a second major in mathematics may take MATH 2500-2501, which will cover the material\nfrom MATH 2300 and 2600 but in a deeper and integrated fashion. Note that while linear algebra is required for\nsome VUSE majors, no VUSE major specifically requires 2600. Students considering this option must discuss this\nwith the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Mathematics and the School of Engineering Office of Academic\nServices.\n\nStudents with inadequate backgrounds in mathematics may be required to take Math 1005 (Pre-calculus\nMathematics). Taking this course constitutes an additional requirement for graduation.\n\nMath 1010-1011 (Probability and Statistical Inference) and Math 1100 (Survey of Calculus) cannot be credited\ntoward a degree in the School of Engineering.\n\nStudents with greater interest in physics may enroll in Phys 1911, 1912, 1912L, and 2255L (Principles of Physics I\nand II and labs) as substitutes for Phys 1601, 1602, 1601L, and 1602L (General Physics I and II and labs),\nrespectively. Students should consult with their Academic Adviser before taking this more advanced Physics\nsequence.\n\nPre-calculus courses Phys 1010, 1010L, 1020, 1020L, 2051, 2052, 2053, and 2054 cannot be credited toward a\ndegree in the School of Engineering.\n\nPage 175 of 1019\n\n\fLiberal Arts Core\nIn order to provide the elements of a general education considered necessary for responsible practice as an\neducated engineer, the School of Engineering requires each student to complete at least 18 hours in the Liberal Arts\nCore comprising:\n1. At least 3 hours selected from courses classified in the AXLE Curriculum Course Distribution as Humanities\nand Creative Arts (HCA), with the exception of CMST 1500, 2100, 2110, and 2120, and\n2. At least 3 hours selected from courses classified in the AXLE Curriculum Course Distribution as Social and\nBehavioral Sciences (SBS).\nThe remaining hours are to be selected from:\n1. Courses classified in the AXLE Curriculum Course Distribution as Humanities and Creative Arts (HCA),\nInternational Cultures (INT), History and Culture of the United States (US), Social and Behavioral Sciences\n(SBS), and Perspectives (P)\n2. CS 1151 and ENGM 2440\n3. ARA, CHEB, CHIN, FREN, GER, GRK, HEBR, HNUR, ITA, JAPN, KICH, KOR, LAT, RUSS, SNSK, and SPAN courses\nnumbered 1101; CHIN and JAPN courses numbered 1011 and 1012; and ENGL and SPAN courses numbered\n1100\n4. AP Credit for AADS 2000 (earned from the AP African American Studies exam).\n5. Peabody College courses in Psychology (PSY-PC) numbered 1205, 1207, 1250, 2200, 2250, 2300, 2400, 2500,\n2550, 2600, and 3150, and in Human and Organizational Development (HOD) numbered 1250, 1300, 2100,\n2260, 2400, 2500, 2700, and HODC 3232\n6. All MUSO, COMP, MREP, MUTH, and performance courses in the Blair School of Music, except MUSO 1001\n7. MS 1510\nImmersion\nImmersion Vanderbilt (vanderbilt.edu/immersion) allows students to pursue a multi-year path to be curious, to\ndevelop their passions and to learn by experience. To fulfill the university requirement of Immersion Vanderbilt, a\nstudent must participate in immersive experiences and then complete a culminating project that is based on one\nspecific immersive experience as described in the Special Programs for Undergraduates section near the start of this\ncatalog.\nThe experiential learning may focus on one or more areas of student interest. Most engineering students will take\nadvantage of a four-year engineering design experience to satisfy the requirements of Immersion Vanderbilt. Each\nengineering major offers such a multi-year experience within its curriculum. Students whose plans include\nprofessional development may also pursue industrial internships. A research path can engage the student in\ndiscovery through research in engineering or other fields. While most engineering students will select an immersion\nexperience associated with their major, students can pursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. For\nexample, students interested in creative expression might develop a performance piece, exhibit, or artistic work,\nwhile those interested in international study may explore firsthand the culture, language, and history of other\ncountries. Students interested in such immersion plans should consult the Office of Experiential Learning and\nImmersion (EL&IV).\n\nThe Immersion Vanderbilt process is composed of several phases. Senior design projects in the School of\nEngineering satisfy the final project requirement for Immersion Vanderbilt, with students presenting the results of\ntheir design project at the school's Design Day or Computer Science Immersion Showcase. For students completing\nother immersion projects, the Office of Experiential Learning and Immersion Vanderbilt coordinates a series of\nshowcases open to the entire campus where students display their projects. Upon completion of the project, Office\nof Experiential Learning and Immersion Vanderbilt conveys that the requirements have been met by showing\ncompletion of the Immersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement on the student's degree audit.\nOpen Electives\nCourses taken beyond specified courses and restricted (such as program, technical, and liberal arts) electives for the\nmajor may be taken as open electives.\nOfficer Education\nCourse offerings in military science and naval science are described in the section on Special Programs for\n\nPage 176 of 1019\n\n\fUndergraduates near the beginning of the catalog. All officer education courses designated as eligible for credit may\nbe taken as open electives. In addition, some officer education courses in history and political science may be taken\nas part of the Liberal Arts Core while some officer education courses in engineering science may be taken as\ntechnical electives. AFROTC students may count 6 hours of the military courses as open electives.\n\nMaster of Engineering\nThe master of engineering (M.Eng.) is an advanced professional degree awarded by the School of Engineering and\nespecially designed for engineering practitioners who may prefer to work while doing professional study. It is also\nsuitable for individuals who apply directly from undergraduate school—but the thrust of the program is toward\nprofessional practice in engineering rather than research or teaching. The degree is offered in biomedical\nengineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, cyber-physical systems, engineering in surgery and\nintervention, engineering management, environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, and risk, reliability,\nand resilience engineering.\n\nStudents must complete 30 hours of approved course work. A maximum of 6 hours of graduate-level course work\nmay be transferred from another institution, and a maximum period of seven years is allowed to complete the\ndegree. An extensive, written design report shall be submitted on a project approved by the student’s project\nadviser.\n\nRegular admission to the Master of Engineering program normally requires graduation from an approved\nundergraduate program in engineering or a related scientific discipline, attainment of a B average in undergraduate\ncourses applicable to the student’s career goals, and recommendations containing favorable appraisals of\nprofessional promise and attitude. A period of successful work experience prior to application to the program will\nalso be given consideration. For information about admissions, application procedures, and application deadlines for\nthe Master of Engineering programs, please visit https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/academics/master-ofengineering-degree.\n\nCurrent undergraduates in the School of Engineering may be eligible to earn the Master of Engineering via the\nIntegrated Bachelor and Master of Engineering program described in the next section of this catalog.\n\nFor international students who did not graduate from an institution in a country where English is the official\nlanguage, proficiency in English must be shown by a minimum score of 89 on the TOEFL or 7 on the IELTS test.\n\nDigital Learning Programs\nThe School of Engineering offers two degree programs online: an M.S. in Computer Science, and an M.Eng. in\nEngineering Management. Courses in these digital learning programs are only available to students enrolled in\nthese online degree programs. For information about admissions, application procedures, and application deadlines\nfor the School of Engineering Digital Learning programs, please visit the website engineeringonline.vanderbilt.edu.\n\nSpecial Programs in the School of Engineering\nHonors Programs\nStudy Abroad\nTeacher Education\nSecond Major\nMinors\nFocus Areas\nDual Degree Program with Fisk University\n\nPage 177 of 1019\n\n\fIntegrated Bachelor and Master of Engineering\nAccelerated Graduate Program in Engineering\n\nHonors Programs\nHonors programs allow selected undergraduate students to develop individually through independent study and\nresearch. Honors programs of each major are described in the Courses of Study section.\n\nRequirements vary somewhat but, in general, to qualify for consideration a student should have (a) completed the\ntechnical course requirements of the first two years, (b) attained a minimum grade average of 3.5 in all work taken\nfor credit, and (c) shown evidence indicating a capacity for independent study and/or research. Formal admission is\nby election of the department concerned. Once admitted, candidates remain in the program only if they maintain a\n3.5 or higher grade point average.\n\nAccepted candidates normally begin honors study in the junior year, but exceptions may be made for outstanding\nseniors.\n\nSuccessful candidates are awarded Honors in their major. This designation appears on their diplomas.\nStudy Abroad\nVanderbilt's Global Education Office offers approximately thirty programs that allow students to take engineering or\ncomputer science courses in English abroad, in locations ranging from Dublin to Sydney, Madrid to Hong Kong.\nThere are no language prerequisites for these programs. These programs also allow students to take a range of\nliberal arts core, major core, and elective courses abroad. In no case, after matriculating at Vanderbilt, may a\nstudent participate in a Vanderbilt-approved study abroad program through a different university or through an\nexternal agency and then seek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt. Financial aid can be used for study abroad\nduring the academic year, and scholarships are available to support Vanderbilt-approved summer study abroad\noptions. Students are encouraged to discuss with their academic advisers how best to incorporate study abroad into\ntheir four-year plans of study. All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt’s\ninternational security provider.\n\nRegistration is completed on your behalf when enrolling in a program offered through the Global Education Office.\nOtherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.\nTeacher Education\nStudents who are interested in preparing for licensure as secondary school teachers should plan their programs in\nconsultation with the associate dean in the School of Engineering and the Director of Secondary Education in the\nDepartment of Teaching and Learning at Peabody College. More specific information on professional education\ncourse requirements can be found under the Licensure for Teaching chapter in the Peabody College section of this\ncatalog. Inquiries can also be made to the Office of Teacher Licensure at Peabody.\nSecond Major\nIt is possible for a student to combine an engineering field with a second area outside the School of Engineering.\nThe student must obtain prior approval of each department and satisfy the requirements of each major, including\nthe requirement regarding minimum grade point average. Students in the School of Engineering may use courses\noutside the School of Engineering for relevant second majors even if those courses also fulfill a degree requirement.\n\nCertain double majors involving two programs within the School of Engineering have been approved by the faculty.\nThe approved double majors are biomedical engineering/electrical and computer engineering, and biomedical\nengineering/chemical engineering.\n\nPage 178 of 1019\n\n\fBoth majors are indicated on the student’s transcript. Only one degree is awarded, from the school in which the\nstudent is enrolled.\nMinors\nA minor consists of at least five courses of at least 3 credit hours each within a recognized area of knowledge. A\nminor offers students more than a casual introduction to an area, but less than a major. A minor is not a degree\nrequirement, but students may elect to complete one or more. Courses may not be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. A\nminor for which all designated courses are completed with a grade point average of at least 2.000 will be entered on\nthe transcript at the time of graduation.\n\nWhen a minor is offered in a discipline that offers a major, only those courses that count toward the major may be\ncounted toward the minor. Students should refer to the appropriate sections of this catalog for specific\nrequirements. Minors are offered in engineering management, materials science and engineering, computer\nscience, data science, digital fabrication, electrical and computer engineering, energy and environmental systems,\nenvironmental engi​neering, nanoscience and nanotechnology, quantum information science and engineering,\nscientific computing, and most disciplines of the College of Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, and Peabody\nCollege.\n\nStudents declare their intention to pursue a minor by completing the online Major/Minor Declaration/Change\nworkflow process found here: https://registrar.vanderbilt.edu/registration/forms.php. Departments and programs\nusually assign advisers to students who declare minors in their areas. Students are responsible for knowing and\nsatisfying all requirements for the minors they intend to complete.\nFocus Areas\nFocus areas provide guidance to students wishing to concentrate on a specialized topic within engineering. Focus\nareas are typically nine credit hours, and qualifying courses are listed in the catalog. Students can declare a\nmaximum of three focus areas; however, a qualifying course cannot be applied to more than one focus area.\nStudents interested in declaring a focus area must do so before the start of their final semester at Vanderbilt.\nSuccessful completion of a declared focus area will be designated on a student's transcript upon graduation.\nThe School of Engineering offers the following focus areas:\nHuman Computer Interaction\nMicroelectronics\nNanotechnology\nStrategic and Technical Consulting\nEngineering Communications\nTechnology Entrepreneurship\nProduct Development\nDual Degree Program with Fisk University\nA coordinated dual degree program between the Vanderbilt University School of Engineering and Fisk University is\nespecially designed to permit students to obtain an A.B. degree in biology, chemistry, computer science, physics, or\nmathematics from Fisk and a B.E. degree in engineering from Vanderbilt, generally within five years.\n\nFor the first three years, the student is enrolled at Fisk in a science or mathematics curriculum and, by crossregistration in the second and third years, takes introductory engineering courses at Vanderbilt. During the fourth\nand fifth years, the student is enrolled at Vanderbilt, following principally an engineering curriculum at Vanderbilt\nand completing necessary courses at Fisk. At the end of five years, the student should be able to satisfy the\nrequirements for both bachelor’s degrees.\n\nFinancial aid is available for qualified, deserving students. Additional information is available from the director of\n\nPage 179 of 1019\n\n\ftransfer admissions in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\nIntegrated Bachelor and Master of Engineering\nOn the basis of recommendations containing favorable appraisals of professional promise, undergraduate students\nin the School of Engineering who have completed at least 75 hours by the end of the second year with at least a\n3.500 grade point average may be accepted into an integrated Bachelor of Engineering–Master of Engineering\nprogram. This program is currently available in chemical, civil, environmental, or mechanical engineering. This\nprogram can also be completed with the Master of Engineering degree in Engineering in Surgery and Intervention\n(ESI) in combination with the bachelor's degree in biomedical, mechanical, electrical and computer engineering, or\nengineering science. The last two years of a student’s program are planned as a unit.\n\nWith the approval of the student’s adviser, the director of graduate studies in the student’s major department, and\nthe senior associate dean for undergraduate education, students apply through the senior associate dean for\ngraduate education for admission to this integrated dual degree program. Upon admission to this program, a\nsecond “career” will be set up for the student which will allow the student to start taking graduate courses (course\nnumbers > 5000) during the junior and senior years. These courses will be credited toward the master of\nengineering.\n\nNote that no double counting of courses is allowed (i.e., the student must meet the degree requirements for each\ndegree independent of the other degree). No more than 18 total credit hours between the two careers can be taken\nin a single semester. The student typically receives the bachelor’s degree at the end of the fourth year and\ncompletes the master of engineering during the fifth year. Further information can be obtained from the director of\ngraduate studies of the student’s major department.\nAccelerated Graduate Program in Engineering\nStudents who enter Vanderbilt with a significant number of credits, earned either through Advanced Placement or\nInternational Baccalaureate tests or in college courses taken during high school, may be eligible for the Accelerated\nGraduate Program in Engineering. Through this program, a student is able to earn both a bachelor’s degree and a\nmaster of science in about the same time required for the bachelor’s degree or slightly longer. To be eligible for the\nprogram, a student must complete 86 hours (senior standing) by the end of the sophomore year with at least a\n3.500 grade point average. With the approval of the student’s adviser, the director of graduate studies in the\nstudent’s major department, and the senior associate dean for undergraduate education, students apply through the\nsenior associate dean for graduate education for admission to this accelerated dual degree program. Upon\nadmission to this program, a second “career” will be set up for the student which will allow the student to start\ntaking graduate courses (course numbers > 5000) during the junior and senior years. These courses will be credited\ntoward the master of science.\n\nNote that no double counting of courses is allowed (i.e., the student must meet the degree requirements for each\ndegree independent of the other degree). No more than 18 total credit hours between the two careers can be taken\nin a single semester. The student receives the bachelor’s degree at the end of the fourth year and typically spends\nthe summer finishing a master’s thesis to complete the master of science. Further information can be obtained from\nthe director of graduate studies of the student’s major department.\n\nHonors in the School of Engineering\nFounder's Medal\nLatin Honors Designation\nDean's List\nHonor Societies\nOther Awards and Prizes\nFounder’s Medal\n\nPage 180 of 1019\n\n\fThe Founder’s Medal, signifying first honors, was endowed by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt as one of his gifts to\nthe university.

Lewis, Marlon Thomas\n\nCOURSES OFFERED: BME\n\nThe foundations of biomedical engineering are the same as those in other engineering disciplines: mathematics,\nphysics, chemistry, and engineering principles. Biomedical engineering builds on these foundations to solve\nproblems in biology and medicine over the widest range of scales-from the nanoscale and molecular levels to the\nwhole body. Biomedical engineering provides a robust platform for employment in the medical device and\ninstrumentation industries as well as careers in companies that specialize in the development and application of\nbiologics, biomaterials, computation, implants and processes. Our graduates gain entry into nationally recognized\ngraduate schools for continuing studies in biomedical engineering.\n\nBiomedical engineering is also a rigorous path for admission to and success in medical school for those students\n\nPage 185 of 1019\n\n\fwilling and able to excel in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and engineering.\n\nThe Department of Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt is unique among biomedical engineering programs in its\nimmediate proximity to the world class Vanderbilt Medical Center, located on our compact campus. Our School of\nMedicine is among the top ten in funding from the National Institutes of Health and includes a National Cancer\nInstitute- recognized Comprehensive Cancer Center, a major children’s hospital and a Level I trauma center. This\nproximity and the strong relationships among faculty across multiple schools stimulate high impact research and\nprovide unique educational and research opportunities for students.\n\nDegree Programs. The Department of Biomedical Engineering offers courses of study leading to the B.E., M.S.,\nM.Eng., and Ph.D. Vanderbilt biomedical engineering is a well-established program with undergraduate degrees\ngranted continuously since 1965. Our undergraduate curriculum undergoes regular review and revision to ensure\nrelevancy and to maintain full ABET accreditation. Students have complete flexibility in the selection of biomedical\nengineering, technical, and open electives. This allows students to design their own focus areas such as\nregenerative medicine and tissue engineering, wearables and point-of-care diagnostics, global health, surgery and\nengineering, robotics and prosthetics, lasers and medicine, medical imaging, biotechnology and nanomedicine,\nmedical technology and entrepreneurship.\n\nFacilities. The Department of Biomedical Engineering is located in Stevenson Center. Undergraduate instructional\nlaboratories are equipped for study of biomedical processes, measurement methods and instrumentation. These\nfacilities are equipped with embedded systems for instrumentation, design, and testing that mirror professional\npractice. Specialized facilities for biomedical imaging, biophotonics, cell and tissue culture, microfabrication, surgery\nand intervention, and nanoengineering are used both for faculty-led research and instructional purposes.\n\nUndergraduate Honors Program. With approval of the Honors Program director, junior and senior students in\nbiomedical engineering who have achieved a minimum grade point average of 3.5 may be accepted into the\nundergraduate Honors Program. Students in the program take at least 6 credit hours of 5000-level or above\n(graduate) biomedical engineering courses, which can be counted toward the 127-hour undergraduate degree\nrequirements as biomedical engineering electives or which can be taken for graduate school credit. Students in the\nHonors Program must also complete a two-semester-long research project and present a research report; this is\ngenerally accomplished through the BME 3860 and 3861 Undergraduate Research elective courses. Honors students\nmust make a grade point average of 3.0 in these classes and maintain an overall 3.5 GPA to be designated as an\nhonors graduate. The diploma designation is Honors in Biomedical Engineering.\n\nCurriculum Requirements\nThe B.E. in biomedical engineering requires a minimum of 127 hours, distributed as follows:\n1.

Each student shall complete at least one immersive experience, followed by a\nculminating project. At its core, Immersion Vanderbilt gives every Vanderbilt student the opportunity to pursue\nintellectual curiosities through immersive experiences and culminating projects that are as creative and unique as\nthe students. Throughout the Immersion Vanderbilt program, students are supported by faculty and the Immersion\nVanderbilt office.\n\nImmersion Vanderbilt is a requirement for all undergraduates. Some majors, minors, programs of study, and classes\nare approved to satisfy the immersive experience, culminating project, or both. To complete the Immersion\nVanderbilt requirement, students engage in one or more experiential learning activities, for which the student has a\nfaculty or staff mentor. The student will complete their immersive experience in one of the six immersion pathways\nof their choosing: 1) Research; 2) Study Abroad; 3) Innovation, Arts, & Design; 4) Civic & Community Engagement;\n5) Leadership & Professional Development; or 6) Internships. When a student engages in research for Immersion, a\nVanderbilt faculty member must be the mentor. Throughout the program, students are prompted to reflect upon\ntheir immersive experiences, which can inform the development of the culminating project. This reflective process\nensures that students gain a deeper understanding of their immersive experience(s) and its significance to their\ngoals.\n\nUpon completing their immersive experience(s), students plan and complete their culminating project. Although\nstudents are encouraged to base their culminating project on their immersive experience(s), this is not required; the\nculminating project can relate to an immersive experience already completed or a new topic. As with the immersive\nexperience, the student completes their culminating project in one of the six immersion pathways: 1) Research; 2)\nStudy Abroad; 3) Innovation, Arts, & Design; 4) Civic & Community Engagement; 5) Leadership & Professional\nDevelopment; or 6) Internship.

[1]\n\nNaval Reserve Officers' Training Corps (NROTC)\nNaval Science\nNaval Science Courses\n\nThe Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) unit at Vanderbilt conducts the Naval Officer Education program.\nChallenging academic courses and experience-building events prepare a select group of highly accomplished\nstudents for the opportunity to serve their country as a Navy or Marine Corps officer and receive an education. The\nprimary focus of the NROTC program is to develop the most capable leaders possible by building upon the academic\nstrength of Vanderbilt and providing essential military and leadership education.\n\nStudents participate in the NROTC unit in the scholarship program, the college program, or the naval science\nprogram. College Program students take the prescribed naval science course each semester, participate weekly in\nnaval science lab, and engage in summer training programs after each academic year. The NROTC College Program\nis identical to the scholarship program except for tuition financial benefit and that students only participate in\nsummer training upon completion of their junior academic year. Also, any Vanderbilt student may take any or all of\nthe naval science courses without participating in naval science lab or summer training.\n\nScholarship students receive tuition, fees, uniforms, $375 per semester for textbooks, and a monthly stipend\nbeginning at $250 for freshmen and increasing to $400 for seniors. Vanderbilt may provide scholarship students\nwith up to a $6,000-per-year stipend toward room and board. College Program students are provided uniforms,\ntextbooks for naval science courses, and a monthly stipend of $350 upon commencement of their junior year with\napproval by higher authority based on academic performance and military aptitude.\n\nPage 30 of 1019\n\n\fScholarships. Students can earn scholarships in several ways. Four-year scholarships are determined by national\ncompetition among high school seniors and graduates. Based on the national ranking, students may be awarded a\nscholarship that covers full tuition. To be eligible, applicants must have less than 30 semester hours of college\ncredit. College Program students can also be nominated for three- and two-year scholarships by the NROTC unit.\nThese nominations are based on the students’ academic and military performance at the college level. Sophomores\nnot enrolled in the College Program are eligible to apply for the two-year NROTC scholarship program. This is a\nnational competition and application is made through the NROTC unit.\nService obligation. For most students at the beginning of their sophomore year, should they choose to continue with\nthe NROTC program, Navy option scholarship students incur a minimum service obligation of five years active duty,\nand Marine option scholarship students incur a minimum service obligation of four years of active duty, to be\nserved upon graduation or withdrawal from the program. College Program students incur a three-year active duty\ncommitment upon graduation or withdrawal from the program. Additional requirements may be required for specific\njob assignments.\n\nSummer training. Summer training for three to four weeks is conducted aboard naval vessels and naval shore\nstations after each of the first three academic years. Scholarship students are normally required to participate each\nyear. All scholarship and College Program midshipmen are required to participate in summer training prior to their\nfinal academic year.\nCourse credit. During the four-year program, NROTC Navy-option students are required to complete eight courses\n(24 hours) of naval science, and Marine-option students are required to complete six courses (18 hours) of naval\nscience. Academic credit awarded varies by course and is outlined in the course descriptions below.\n\nRequired Courses for Navy/Marine Scholarship. The following courses are required for students on scholarship:\nCalculus (Navy option only) (6 credits minimum): Mathematics 1200–1201, or 1300–1301 completed by the\nend of the sophomore year.\nPhysics (Navy option only) (6 credits): 1501–1502 or 1601–1602 completed by the end of the junior year.\nEnglish (6 credits): Two semesters of any English course or courses containing a designated writing\ncomponent.\nAmerican History/National Security Policy (3 credits): Contact the Naval ROTC unit for a listing of courses\nfulfilling this requirement.\nWorld Culture/Regional Studies (Navy option only) (3 credits): Contact the Naval ROTC unit for a listing of\ncourses fulfilling this requirement.\n\nInformation. Inquiries regarding enrollment in the Naval ROTC program should be made to the Naval ROTC unit\nrecruiting officer at (615) 322-2671, or by contacting a local Navy or Marine Corps recruiting station.\n\nAdmission to the program is open to both men and women. Physical qualification to Naval Service standards is\nrequired.\n\nNaval Science\nCOMMANDING OFFICER Aaron Buckles\nEXECUTIVE OFFICER Brian Fremming\nNAVAL INSTRUCTORS Arthur Busick, Renny Ignacio\nMARINE INSTRUCTOR Kenneth St Cyr\n\nNaval Science Courses\n\nPage 31 of 1019\n\n\fFor Navy-option NROTC students, the following naval science courses are required for commissioning: NS 1100, HIST\n1690, NS-PC 2410, ES 3231, ES 3230, ES 3232, ES 4233, and NS-PC 4242 and their appropriate labs.

All available information is considered, including secondary school\nacademic record, evidence of academic maturity and independence, extracurricular activities, contributions to and\nimpact on the school and community, scores on standardized tests if submitted (see #3 in Application Procedure\nbelow), and letters of recommendation.\n\nThe admissions process supports the university's mission of scholarship and discovery and is designed to select a\nstudent body with exceptional academic talent, high standards of personal character, serious educational aims, and\nwide-ranging backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Policies that govern the selection process have been set\n\nPage 32 of 1019\n\n\fby the vice provost for university enrollment affairs. Please refer to the nondiscrimination statement which appears\nearlier in this catalog.\n\nAdmission to the four undergraduate schools is managed by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\n\nProspective students are encouraged to investigate the university by visiting the campus, exploring the Office of\nUndergraduate Admissions website, connecting via social media, and attending college fairs and other programs\nhosted by Vanderbilt admissions officers across the country, around the world, and online. Admissions staff are\navailable to answer questions, assist with understanding campus visit opportunities, provide additional information\nabout degree programs, and link visitors with appropriate campus offices and members of the university community.\nAcademic Preparation\nEvery candidate for admission must present an official transcript of work completed in high school. While our\nadmissions process is holistic, most successful candidates will present a curriculum that includes the equivalent of\nfive academic subjects each year for four years. Recommended course work includes 4 units of English, 4 units of\nmathematics, 4 units of natural science, 2 units of foreign language, 2 units of social science/humanities, and 4 units\nof additional course work in these areas, or other academic courses such as engineering science, computer science,\nsocial science or natural science research, or advanced work in the humanities. Close attention will be paid to the\nrigor of course work presented. It is highly recommended that candidates applying to the School of Engineering have\ntaken calculus, calculus-based physics, and chemistry.\n\nMost successful candidates will have meaningfully engaged with the academic, intellectual, social, and leadership\nopportunities available in the context of their high schools and communities. In exceptionally rare cases, students\nmay be considered for admission before completing four years of high school. In these cases, the Admissions\nCommittee considers especially evidence of maturity and readiness for an immersive, residential college\nexperience.\nApplication Procedure — First-year Applicants\n1.

International applicants must complete all admission\nrequirements of the university. (See “Application Procedure” above, for first-year and for transfer applicants.)\n\nApplicants whose first language or language of instruction is not English are required to submit the results of the\nTest of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) iBT (including Home and Paper editions) TOEFL Essentials, the\nInternational English Language Testing Service (IELTS), the Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), the\nDuolingo English Test (DET), or the Cambridge English C1 Advanced or C2 Proficiency. This testing requirement may\nbe waived if a student has scored above a 26 on the ACT English section or above 630 on the SAT Evidence-based\nReading and Writing section. Minimum recommended scores for Vanderbilt are 100 TOEFL iBT, 10.5 on the TOEFL\nEssentials, 7.0 on the IELTS, 70 on the PTE Academic, 130 on the Duolingo English Test, and 185 on the Cambridge\nEnglish C1 Advanced or C2 Proficiency.\n\nAdvanced Credit\nAdvanced Credit\nCollege Entrance Exams\nAdvanced Placement Credit Policy\nInternational Baccalaureate Credit Policy\nAdvanced Placement Examination Grades Accepted by Various Departments at Vanderbilt for Advanced Placement\nwith Credit\nInternational Baccalaureate Scores Accepted by Various Departments at Vanderbilt for Advanced Credit\nPre-College Summer School Program\nCredit for Previous College Work\n\nPage 34 of 1019\n\n\fAdvanced Credit\nHonors courses and other accelerated study in high school are excellent preparation for Vanderbilt. The wellestablished advanced-placement policy endeavors to recognize exceptional high school preparation, to avoid\nrequiring first-year students to take courses clearly mastered in high school, and to encourage students to begin\ntheir college learning experience at the level most appropriate to their preparation. Advanced placement may be\ngranted on the basis of good performance on the College Board Advanced Placement Examinations, on International\nBaccalaureate tests, or, in some cases, on placement tests given by Vanderbilt. Credit may also be awarded for the\nBritish G.C.E. “A” level examinations, the Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE), the Cambridge PreU diploma, and similar tests, such as the French baccalauréat, the German abitur, or the Swiss maturité\nexaminations. To qualify for credit for the AICE examinations or individual A-level examinations, students must have\nachieved an A*, A, or B thereon. More information on international exam credit is available at\nregistrar.vanderbilt.edu/international-examinations.\n\nCollege Entrance Exams\nStudents may not take college entrance exams after they begin their enrollment at Vanderbilt University for the\npurpose of course placement or academic credit. This applies to SAT, ACT, Advanced Placement, International\nBaccalaureate, and any similar international exams.\n\nAdvanced Placement Credit Policy\nAdvanced Placement Examination grades accepted for advanced placement with credit by the various departments\nat Vanderbilt are listed below. At the determination of individual departments, Advanced Placement Examination\ngrades with a score of 4 or 5 may be accepted for credit. The amount of credit that may be awarded corresponds to\nthe course work waived. Advanced Placement credit does not affect the Vanderbilt grade point average.\n\nStudents of the College of Arts and Science are limited to a total of 18 credit hours earned by any combination of\nadvanced placement, international baccalaureate credit, advanced international credit, and credit by departmental\nexamination, counting toward the minimum number of hours required toward the degree. For students in the\nCollege of Arts and Science, no form of advanced placement credit can be used to fulfill the Achieving Excellence in\nLiberal Education (AXLE) requirements.\n\nInternational Baccalaureate Credit Policy\nInternational Baccalaureate test scores accepted for advanced credit by the various departments at Vanderbilt are\nlisted below. Students who have taken tests in other areas may submit their scores to the Office of Academic\nServices for evaluation by the appropriate departments. Credits are awarded for exams taken at the higher level\nonly. The amount of credit that may be awarded is subject to the same limitations as credit for Advanced Placement.\n\nAdvanced Placement Examination Grades Accepted by Various Departments at Vanderbilt for Advanced\nPlacement with Credit\nAP Exam\n\nAP Score Vanderbilt Course or Credit Equivalent\n\nCredit Hours\n\nAfrican American Studies\n\nAfrican American Studies\n\n4 or 5\n\nAADS No Equivalent\n\n3\n\nArt History\n\n4 or 5\n\nStudio Art: 2-D Design\n\n4 or 5\n\nHART 1100: History of Western Art I\nHART 1105: History of Western Art II\nARTS No Equivalent: Art Studio\n\n3\n3\n3\n\nArt\n\nPage 35 of 1019\n\n\fStudio Art: 3-D Design\nStudio Art: Drawing\n\n4 or 5\n4 or 5\n\nARTS No Equivalent: Art Studio\nARTS No Equivalent: Art Studio\n\n3\n3\n\n5\n\nCS 1101: Programming & Problem Solving\n\n3\n\n5\n\nCS 1000: The Beauty and Joy of Computing\n\n3\n\n4 or 5\n4 or 5\n\nECON 1010: Principles of Macroeconomics\nECON 1020: Principles of Microeconomics\n\n3\n3\n\n4 or 5\n\nENGL 1300W: Intermediate Composition\n\n3\n\n4 or 5\n\nENGL 1220W: Drama Forms and Techniques\n\n3\n\nENGL 1230W: Literature and Analytical Thinking\n\n3\n\nComputer Science\n\nComputer Science A\nComputer Science\nPrinciples\n\nEconomics\n\nMacroeconomics\nMicroeconomics\n\nEnglish\n\nEnglish Language &\nComposition\nEnglish Literature &\nComposition\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nGovernment & Politics:\nComparative\n\n4 or 5\n\nPSCI 1101: Introduction to Comparative Politics\n\n3\n\nGovernment & Politics:\nUnited States\n\n4 or 5\n\nPSCI 1100: Introduction to American Government and\nPolitics\n\n3\n\n4 or 5\n4 or 5\n4 or 5\n\nHIST No Equivalent: European History\nHIST No Equivalent: U.S. History\nHIST No Equivalent: World History\n\n3\n3\n3\n\n4\n\nCHIN 2201: Intermediate Chinese I\n\n5\n\n5\n\nCHIN 2201: Intermediate Chinese II\n\n5\n\nFREN 2203: Contemporary Francophone Cultures\nFREN 2501W: French Composition and Grammar\nGER 2201: Intermediate German I\nGER 2202: Intermediate German II\n\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\nITA 2203: Italian Journeys\n\n3\n\nITA 2501W: Grammar and Composition\n\n3\n\nJAPN 2201: Intermediate Japanese I\n\n3\n\nHistory\n\nEuropean History\nUnited States History\nWorld History\nHuman Geography (No credit)\n\nLanguages\n\nChinese Language and\nCulture\nChinese Language and\nCulture\nFrench Language\n\n4 or 5\n\nGerman Language\n\n4 or 5\n\nItalian Language and\nCulture\n\n4 or 5\n\nJapanese Language and\nCulture\n\n4\n\nPage 36 of 1019\n\n\fJapanese Language and\nCulture\nLatin\nSpanish Language or\nLiterature (beyond Fall\n\n5\n\nJAPN 2202: Intermediate Japanese II\n\n3\n\n4 or 5\n\nLAT 2202: Intermediate Latin: Poetry\n\n3\n\n4\n\nSPAN 2010: Non-equivalent credit; convertible to SPAN\n2204 with proctored departmental placement score of 410\nor above.\n\n3\n\n5\n\nSPAN 2012: Non-equivalent credit; convertible to SPAN\n3302 with proctored departmental placement score of 460\nor above.\n\n3\n\n5\n\nSPAN 2011: Non-equivalent credit; convertible to SPAN\n3301W with proctored departmental placement score of 460\nor above.\n\n3\n\n5\n\nMATH 1300: Accelerated Single-Variable Calculus I\n\n4\n\n3&5\n\nMATH 1300: Accelerated Single-Variable Calculus I\n\n4\n\n4&5\n\nMATH 1300: Accelerated Single-Variable Calculus I\n\n4\n\n5\n\nMATH 1300: Accelerated Single-Variable Calculus I\nMATH 1301: Accelerated Single-Variable Calculus II\nNo credit\n\n4\n4\n\n5\n\nMUTH 1200: Survey of Music Theory\n\n3\n\n2021 admission)\nSpanish Language\n\n(beyond Fall 2021\nadmission)\nSpanish Literature\n\n(beyond Fall 2021\nadmission)\nMathematics\n\nCalculus AB\nCalculus BC & AB\nSubscore\nCalculus BC & AB\nSubscore\nCalculus BC\nPrecalculus\nMusic\n\nMusic Theory\n\nNo course credit awarded for music majors.\nPsychology\n\nPsychology\n\n5\n\nPSY 1200: General Psychology\n\n3\n\nBSCI 1100: Biology Today\nBSCI 1100L: Biology Today Laboratory\nCHEM 1601: General Chemistry\nCHEM 1601L: General Chemistry Laboratory\nCHEM 1602: General Chemistry\nCHEM 1602L: General Chemistry Laboratory\nEES No Equivalent\nPHYS 1010: Introductory Physics\nPHYS 1010L: Introductory Physics Lab\n\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n3\n1\n\nSciences\n\nBiology\nChemistry\n\nEnvironmental Science\nPhysics 1\n\n4 or 5\n5\n\n4 or 5\n5\n\nNone of the credits awarded for Physics 1 shall count toward the major or the minor in physics.

Program\nUpon completion of the sophomore or junior year in high school, students may enroll, at the freshman level, for\nregular work in the Vanderbilt summer session.\n\nThe following conditions must be met: (a) students must be in the upper 25 percent of their high school class and be\nrecommended by their principal or counselor; (b) courses taken in the Vanderbilt summer session must be chosen\nby the student in consultation with his or her high school counselor and the director of the Division of Unclassified\nStudies so as to supplement and not overlap the total high school program. A student may take two courses in any\none summer, or three courses by special authorization of the director of the Division of Unclassified Studies.\n\nCourse work done at Vanderbilt by a pre-college student may count toward the high school diploma and as part of\nthe entrance requirements for regular admission to Vanderbilt. All course work done at Vanderbilt by pre-college\nstudents will be credited toward the degree for those who may subsequently matriculate at Vanderbilt, unless the\ncourse work is required for high school graduation. Admission to the pre-college summer school program does not\nadmit a student as a regular entering freshman, nor does it commit the university to a student’s admission.\n\nCredit for Previous College Work\nEntering first-year students who have taken college work in high school through dual enrollment or concurrent\nenrollment programs, or during summers prior to their offer of admission to Vanderbilt, must indicate such work on\nthe undergraduate admission application. An official transcript showing any prior college work must be provided.\nOnce all required documentation has been received, the coursework will be reviewed to determine whether it is\neligible for credit at Vanderbilt.\n\nStudents should submit all required documentation for review before the first day of classes of their freshman year.\n\nCredit will be awarded only if:\n1. A course is regularly offered by an accredited two-year or four-year college or university. For domestic\nschools, the school must be regionally accredited; for international schools, the school must have countryspecific accreditation.\n2. The teacher was a regular faculty member of that college or university.\n3. A majority of the students in the course were degree-seeking college students.\nAdditional requirements and guidelines regarding pre-freshman credit are available\nat registrar.vanderbilt.edu/transfer-credit.php.\n\nThe College of Arts and Science and Peabody College usually do not award credit for work at other colleges in the\nsummer immediately preceding the student’s first semester at Vanderbilt. Summer work elsewhere will be accepted\nfor credit only if an unusual educational opportunity can be demonstrated and if the courses sought are as rigorous\nas courses offered at Vanderbilt. Approval for work to be taken elsewhere must be obtained in advance from the\nappropriate dean.\n\nPage 41 of 1019\n\n\fCollege of Arts and Science. In no case may credits completed elsewhere after the student has been offered\nadmission by the College of Arts and Science satisfy AXLE requirements.\n\nInternational Students\nVanderbilt has a large international community representing more than 95 countries. The university welcomes the\ndiversity international students bring to the campus and encourages academic and social interactions at all levels.\n\nAdmission.

To meet requirements for entry into the United States for study, applicants must demonstrate\nthat they have sufficient financial resources to meet the expected costs of their educational program. Applicants\nmust provide documentary evidence of their financial resources before visa documents can be issued.\n\nUnited States laws and regulations restrict the opportunity for international students in a non-immigrant visa status\nto be employed. Undergraduate international students are allowed to work on campus for nineteen hours per week\nwhile school is in session. Students may be allowed to work off campus only under special circumstances and after\napproval from ISSS. Many spouses and dependents of international students are not allowed to be employed while in\nthe United States.\n\nLimited need-based financial aid is available to students who are neither citizens nor permanent residents of the\nUnited States, and are considered to be international students in Vanderbilt’s admissions process. Our admissions\nprocess is need-aware for international students; international students who demonstrate that they can afford the\ncost of attending Vanderbilt will be given preferential treatment. To apply for need-based financial aid, international\nstudents are required to submit the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Financial Aid Profile. Based upon an\nevaluation of academic qualities, financial need, and availability of resources, an international student may be\nconsidered for need-based financial assistance. International students who apply for need-based financial aid will be\nadmitted only if they are competitive in our holistic review and if Vanderbilt is able to provide adequate financial\nassistance.\n\nInternational Student Health Insurance. International students are required to have health insurance throughout\ntheir academic program and are automatically enrolled in the Vanderbilt-approved health insurance plan for\ninternational students.

While continuing to meet the full demonstrated need of all eligible students,\nthis expanded aid initiative, Opportunity Vanderbilt, announced in October 2008 provides increased amounts of\nneed- based grants and/or scholarships (gift assistance) to replace need-based loans that would have otherwise\nbeen offered to meet a student’s demonstrated financial need.\n\nDemonstrated financial need is the difference between the cost of attending Vanderbilt and the amount that\nstudents and their families are expected to contribute toward that cost. The amount of aid to fully meet each\nstudent’s demonstrated financial need is determined annually on the basis of current financial information\nrequired/provided on relevant application forms.\n\nAdditional information is available at https://www.vanderbilt.edu/financialaid/undergraduate/index.php.\n\nUniversity General Medals, Prizes, and Awards\nAlso see the Honors chapters in the College of Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, School of Engineering, and\nPeabody College sections of this catalog for listings of additional awards and prizes.\n\nTHE JESSICA ACESTE AND ELIZABETH BEALE RIPPLE IN THE POND AWARD was established in 2001 by Mr. and Mrs.\nGeorge G.

Failure\nto do so may jeopardize graduation.\nClass Attendance (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: Students are expected to attend all scheduled meetings of classes in which they are enrolled; they\nhave an obligation to contribute to the academic performance of all students by full participation in the work of each\nclass. At the beginning of the semester, instructors explain the policy regarding absences in each of their classes,\nand thereafter they report to the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education in the College of Arts and Science the\nname of any student whose achievement in a course is being adversely affected by excessive absences. In such\ncases an associate dean, in consultation with the instructor, takes appropriate action, which may include dropping\nthe student from the class; students dropped after the deadline for withdrawal (see Period for Withdrawal) receive\nthe grade F. Class attendance may be specified as a factor in determining the final grade in a course, and it cannot\nfail to influence the grade even when it is not considered explicitly.\n\nPage 56 of 1019\n\n\fThe last day before and the first day after official holidays are considered to be the same as any other day on which\nclasses are scheduled. Assignments are made for classes scheduled on these days, and tests may be given in them.\nStudents should take this fact into account in making travel plans.\n\nThe faculty of the College of Arts and Science recognizes that occasions arise during the academic year that merit\nthe excused absence of a student from a scheduled class or laboratory during which an examination, quiz, or other\ngraded exercise is given. Examples include participation in sponsored university activities (e.g., debate team,\nvarsity sports), observance of officially designated religious holidays, serious personal problems (e.g., serious\nillness, death of a member of the student’s family), and matters relating to the student’s academic training (e.g.,\ngraduate or professional school interviews). While determination of the merit of a case is left primarily to the\ndiscretion of the individual instructor, conflicts arising from personal travel plans or social obligations do not qualify\nas excused absences. The Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education does not grant excused absences for students.\nFor more information please visit as.vanderbilt.edu/academics/policies/absences.php.\n\nThe primary determination of whether a student’s absence from class occurs for a reason that warrants\nrescheduling a graded exercise for that student is left to the judgment of the individual instructor. A standard of\nreasonableness should apply in making such judgments.\n\nExcept in cases of true emergency, student petitions for making up missed graded exercises must be made prior to\nthe missed class, preferably at the beginning of the semester or at the earliest time thereafter when the need to be\nabsent is known to the student. Faculty members retain discretion in the form and timing of makeup exercises or in\ndevising other strategies for accommodating students.\n\nThe faculty of the College of Arts and Science authorizes the Office of the Dean to resolve through arbitration any\ncases that cannot be directly resolved between students and their instructors.\n\nBlair: Students are expected to attend all sessions of each class in which they are enrolled.

The last day before and the first day after official holidays\nare considered to be the same as any other day on which classes are scheduled. Assignments are made for classes\nscheduled on these days, and tests may be given in them. Students should take this fact into account in making\ntravel plans.\n\nEngineering: Students are expected to attend all scheduled meetings of each class in which they are enrolled.

In such cases, the dean, in consultation with the\ninstructor, takes appropriate action, which may include dropping the student from the class; students dropped after\nthe deadline for withdrawal receive the grade F. Class attendance may be specified as a factor in determining the\nfinal grade in a course, and it cannot fail to influence the grade even when it is not considered explicitly.\nClassroom Recording Policy (A&S, Blair)\nArts & Science/Blair: The use of technologies for audio and video recording of lectures and other classroom\nactivities is allowed only with the express permission of the instructor. In cases where recordings are allowed, such\ncontent is restricted to personal use only unless permission is expressly granted in writing by the instructor and by\n\nPage 57 of 1019\n\n\fother classroom participants, including other students. Personal use is defined as use by an individual student for\nthe purpose of studying or completing course assignments. When students have permission for personal use of\nrecordings, they must still obtain written permission from the instructor to share recordings with others.\n\nFor students registered with the Office of Student Access Services and who have been approved for audio and/or\nvideo recording of lectures and other classroom activities as a reasonable accommodation, applicable federal law\nrequires instructors to permit those recordings. Such recordings are also limited to personal use, except with\npermission of the instructor and other students in the class.\n\nAcademic Advising (Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nBlair: All entering students are assigned academic advisers who assist in the planning of programs and course\nschedules. Students are required to meet with their advisers prior to registration for each semester.\n\nEngineering: A faculty adviser is appointed for each student. This adviser is chosen from the faculty in the\nstudent’s major, when the major is known. For students who have not chosen a major upon entry, an adviser who\nspecializes in helping undeclared students explore different pathways and decide upon a major is assigned. If a\nstudent later chooses a different department for his or her major, a corresponding change of adviser is made.\nEngineering students are required to see their advisers at registration and any other time changes must be made in\ntheir programs of study. Any student who has academic difficulty is expected to see his or her faculty adviser for\ncounsel. Faculty advisers can also provide useful career guidance.\n\nPeabody: Each Peabody undergraduate is assigned an academic adviser who is familiar with his or her major. This\nadviser is generally a faculty member in the major department and is knowledgeable about the courses the student\nwill need to complete his or her major. The adviser helps the student determine the courses that are most suitable\nfor the chosen major and serves as a mentor to the student.\n\nHowever, enrollment in appropriate courses to fulfill degree requirements and knowledge of university policies and\nregulations regarding courses are the responsibility of the individual student.\n\nCourse Enrollment & Management\nRegistration (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nNormal Course Load (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nChange of Course (Blair, VUSE)\nPass/Fail (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nWithdrawal (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nTaking Courses for No Credit (A&S, Blair)\nAuditing (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nIndependent Study (A&S, Blair, PBDY)\nMinimum Graded Credit Hours (A&S)\nDuplication of Course Content (A&S, PBDY)\nRepeated Courses (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nUndergraduate Enrollment in Graduate School Courses (A&S, VUSE, PBDY)\nReserving Credit for Graduate School (A&S, PBDY)\nRegistration (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\n\nPage 58 of 1019\n\n\fArts & Science: A period is designated in each semester during which continuing students, after consultation with\ntheir advisers, register for work to be taken during the next term. The student’s adviser must release the advising\nhold in YES before the student can register.\n\nStudents are asked to plan their immediate and long-range educational programs with their advisers before\nregistering and to consult their advisers when they make changes in their registration.\n\nStudents not meeting specified tuition payment deadlines are not permitted to register. See the chapter on Financial\nInformation for details.\nBefore registering, students should check their own records carefully with respect to the following items:\n1. AXLE requirements;\n2. Major requirements;\n3. Requirements of any optional minor(s) sought;\n4. Course prerequisites.\nBlair: Registration is available to entering first-year students in June. Continuing students register on dates\nspecified each semester in the University Calendar and as assigned in “YES” (Your Enrollment\nServices, yes.vanderbilt.edu). Conferences with faculty advisers are required before students may register. Detailed\ninformation on registration is available on the University Registrar\nwebsite, registrar.vanderbilt.edu/registration/registration-info.php. Prior to registration, students should refer to the\nsample curriculum plans in the Blair Student Handbook.\n\nRecords and the degree audit should be checked regarding progress toward completing the following:\n1. Music core\n2. Liberal arts core\n3. Additional major area requirements\nA student whose registration choices are denied or altered (full or cancelled class, lack of prerequisite courses, etc.)\nmay select alternate courses during the Open Enrollment registration period.\n\nEngineering: A period is designated in each semester during which continuing students, after consultation with\ntheir advisers, register for work to be taken during the next term. Students can access their registration\nappointment times and the registration system via YES (Your Enrollment Services) at yes.vanderbilt.edu.\nNormal Course Load (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: Each semester, regular tuition is charged on the basis of a normal course load of 12 to 18\nsemester hours. No more than 18 or fewer than 12 credit hours may be taken in any one semester without\nauthorization of the Administrative Committee or an associate dean in 350 Buttrick Hall. (There is an extra charge\nfor more than 18 credit hours at the current hourly rate.) First-year students may not take more than 18 credit hours\nin a semester.\n\nStudents permitted to take fewer than 12 credit hours are placed on probation, unless their light load is necessary\nbecause of outside employment or illness. During the summer session, there is no minimum course load. Summer\nloads exceeding 14 credit hours must be authorized by an associate dean in 350 Buttrick Hall.\n\nCredit hours are semester hours; e.g., a three-hour course carries credit of 3 semester hours. One semester credit\nhour represents at least three hours of academic work per week, on average, for one semester. Academic work\nincludes, but is not necessarily limited to, lectures, laboratory work, homework, research, class readings,\nindependent study, internships, practica, studio work, recitals, practicing, rehearsing, and recitations. Some\nVanderbilt courses may have requirements that exceed this definition.\n\nPage 59 of 1019\n\n\fA student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 credit hours to be classified as a full-time student.\n\nBlair: Tuition is charged on the basis of a normal course load of 12 to 18 semester hours. Course loads outside the\nnorm, which must be recommended by the student’s adviser and approved by the associate dean, are charged at\nan hourly tuition rate. Students who enroll in fewer than 12 hours are placed on probation, unless their underload is\nnecessary because of outside employment or illness. The maximum course load for the summer session is 12 hours\n(6 hours for a summer half-session). A student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 hours to be classified as a fulltime student.\n\nEngineering: Each semester, regular tuition is charged on the basis of a normal course load of 12 to 18 semester\nhours. No more than 18 or fewer than 12 hours may be taken in any one semester without authorization from the\nsenior associate dean.\nThere is an extra charge for more than 18 hours at the current hourly rate. Students permitted to take fewer than\n12 hours are placed on probation, unless their light load is necessary because of illness or outside employment and\nis approved by the senior associate dean. A student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 hours to be classified as a\nfull-time student.\n\nPeabody: A student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 hours to be classified as a full-time student. Students\nwishing to carry more than 18 hours must obtain the approval of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic\nAffairs. All undergraduate students are assumed to be full-time students for the purpose of administering probation\nand retention policies. A student who for reasons of health, family, or outside employment wishes to enroll in\nPeabody as a part-time student must obtain permission from the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic\nAffairs. The academic standing of such students will be considered on an individual basis. Normally, however, a\nstudent earning less than 12 hours will be placed on academic probation.\nChange of Course (Blair, VUSE)\nBlair: Course changes may be made during the Open Enrollment period or the official Change Period (Drop/Add) as\npublished in the University Calendar. All changes need the adviser’s approval. A course dropped during the Change\nPeriod does not show on a transcript.\n\nA course may be dropped or changed from P/F to graded status prior to the deadline for withdrawal published in the\nUniversity Calendar. The approval of the adviser and associate dean is required (see Grading System regarding\nwithdrawal grades). Regularly enrolled students must maintain a minimum course load of 12 hours.\n\nEngineering: During the change period of registration as defined in the Academic Calendar, students may add or\ndrop courses without academic penalty. No record of courses dropped during the change period appears on the\nacademic record. After the change period, new courses may not be added, except under very unusual\ncircumstances and with the approval of the adviser, the course instructor, and the senior associate dean.\nPass/Fail (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: Students may elect to take a limited number of courses on a Pass/Fail (P/F) basis. To enroll for a\ncourse on a Pass/Fail basis, students must have achieved at least sophomore standing, and must not be on\nacademic probation. A minimum 12 graded credit hours is required.\n\nA graduating senior who has permission to take fewer than 12 credit hours on a graded basis may take one course\non a P/F basis in addition to the courses required for graduation. If the student does not graduate at the end of that\nsemester, the P grade is automatically converted to the grade actually earned.\n\nPage 60 of 1019\n\n\fNo more than 18 credit hours graded P may be counted toward the degree, and no more than one course per term\nmay be taken P/F.\n\nThe P/F option does not apply to courses in the following categories:\n1. Courses counted toward AXLE requirements;\n2. Courses in the major field(s), other courses that may be counted toward the major(s), or courses required for\nthe major(s);\n3. For students with a defined interdisciplinary major, courses that are required for the major or that are eligible\nto count toward the major;\n4. For students with an individually designed interdisciplinary major, courses listed in the student’s plan of\nstudy;\n5. For students planning an optional minor, courses in the minor field or those eligible to count toward an\ninterdisciplinary minor;\n6. Courses eligible to count toward the major or minor, regardless of whether the student has already satisfied\nmajor or minor requirements;\n7. Courses that have been specifically excluded from the P/F option;\n8. Courses taken previously.\nStudents may elect grading on a Pass/Fail basis or change from Pass/Fail to graded status until the deadline date for\nwithdrawing from a course that is published in the Academic Calendar. Pass/Fail rules, requirements, and deadlines\nare not petitionable.\n\nThose electing the Pass/Fail option must meet all course requirements (e.g. reports, papers, examinations,\nattendance, etc.) and are graded in the normal way. Instructors are not informed of the names of students enrolled\non a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the semester, a regular grade is submitted for the student enrolled under the P/F\noption. Any grade of D– or above is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F will be recorded if a\nstudent enrolled under this option fails the course. The P grade is not counted in the grade point average nor used\nin the determination of honors. The grade of F earned under the Pass/Fail option is included in the calculation of the\ngrade point average.\n\nThe grade for a class will be converted from P to the recorded letter grade if a student later declares a major or\nminor toward which that class counts. The recorded letter grade will be included in both the overall and the major or\nminor grade point average.\n\nBlair: Students may elect to take a limited number of courses on a Pass/Fail (P/F) basis. To enroll for a course on a\nPass/Fail basis, students must have completed at least two semesters at Vanderbilt, must have achieved at least\nsophomore standing, and must not be on academic probation. The Blair Office of Academic Services can assist with\nP/F registration.\n\nFor B.Mus. and B.Mus.Arts students, the Pass/Fail option is limited to courses taken as free electives. Course work in\nthe area of a minor or second major is governed by the school in which the department or program is housed. No\nmore than one course may be elected on a Pass/Fail basis in any one semester. Only a total of 18 hours towards the\n126-hour degree total may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. Students electing course work on a Pass/Fail basis must be\nenrolled for 12 graded hours. A graduating senior who has permission to take fewer than 12 hours on a graded basis\nmay take one course on a P/F basis in addition to the courses required for graduation. If the student does not\ngraduate at the end of that semester, the grade P is automatically converted to the grade actually earned.\n\nStudents may register for grading on a Pass/Fail basis and may change from Pass/Fail to graded status until the\ndeadline date for withdrawing from a course that is published in the Academic Calendar.\n\nThose electing the Pass/Fail option must meet all course requirements (e.g., reports, papers, examinations,\nattendance, etc.) and are graded in the normal way. Instructors are not informed of the names of students enrolled\n\nPage 61 of 1019\n\n\fon a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the semester, a regular grade is submitted for the student enrolled under the P/F\noption. Any grade of D- or above is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F will be recorded if a\nstudent enrolled under this option fails the course. The P grade is not counted in the grade point average nor used\nin the determination of honors. The grade of F earned under the Pass/Fail option is included in the calculation of the\ngrade point average.\n\nEngineering: Students may elect to take a limited number of courses on a Pass/Fail basis. To enroll for a course on\na Pass/Fail basis, students must have completed at least two semesters at Vanderbilt, must have achieved at least\nsophomore standing, and must not be on academic probation.\n\nIn addition, the following regulations apply to students enrolled in the School of Engineering:\n1. No more than 9 hours graded Pass will be accepted toward the B.S. or B.E. degree, as designated by each\nprogram's curriculum.\n2. No more than two courses may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis in any one semester.\n3. A minimum of 12 hours must be taken on a graded basis in any semester that a Pass/Fail course is taken. A\ngraduating senior who needs fewer than 12 hours to graduate may take courses on a Pass/Fail basis as long\nas he or she takes the number of hours needed to graduate on a graded basis.\n4. Students may elect grading on a Pass/Fail basis and may change from Pass/Fail to graded status until the\ndeadline date for withdrawing from a course that is published in the Academic Calendar.\nPass/Fail Electives Options by Program\nOpen Elective\n\nLiberal Arts Core\n\nBME\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCE\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCHE\n\nX\n\nCMPE\n\nX\n\nCS\n\nX\n\nECE\n\nX\n\nES\n\nX\n\nX\n\nME\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nTechnical Elective\n\nX\n\nX (non-ME)\n\nThose electing the Pass/Fail option must meet all course requirements (e.g., reports, papers, examinations,\nattendance, etc.) and are graded in the normal way. Instructors are not informed of the names of students enrolled\non a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the semester, a regular grade is submitted for the student enrolled under the P/F\noption. Any grade of D- or above is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F will be recorded if a\nstudent enrolled under this option fails the course. The P grade is not counted in the grade point average or used in\nthe determination of honors. The grade of F earned under the Pass/Fail option is included in the calculation of the\ngrade point average.\n\nPeabody: Students may elect to take some courses in which they can receive the grade P (Pass). This grade is\nentered for the student enrolled under the P/F option who is awarded a grade of D- or higher. The grade P is neither\ncounted in the grade point average nor used in the determination of honors. A failing grade will appear on the\nstudent record as F and will be counted in the student’s grade point average.\n\nTo be eligible for the P/F option, the student must have completed two regular semesters at Vanderbilt and must not\nbe on academic probation. No more than one course per semester may be taken on a P/F basis and no more than\nthree total during the undergraduate career. No more than one course from any Liberal Education Core area (e.g.,\ncommunications, humanities) may be taken under this option.\n\nPage 62 of 1019\n\n\fNote that neither courses taken for transfer credit (grade of “T”) nor courses that are only offered on a pass/fail\nbasis by the university (e.g., certain field experience courses) are counted against the number of courses that a\nstudent may voluntarily elect to take on a pass/fail basis, either within or across semesters.\n\nThe P/F option does not apply to courses in the following categories:\n1. Liberal Education Core Courses that have been specifically identified by the student’s primary major as\nneeding to be taken on a graded basis.\n2. For students with a single or double major, courses in the department(s) of the major(s) or other courses that\nmay be counted for the major(s);\n3. For students with an interdisciplinary major, courses listed in the student’s plan of study;\n4. For students planning an optional minor, courses in the department of the minor or those counting toward an\ninterdisciplinary minor.\nStudents taking a course on a P/F basis must be enrolled for at least 12 additional hours on a regularly graded basis.\nIf a student drops a course and falls below 12 graded hours, the P/F course is converted automatically to a regularly\ngraded basis.\n\nSeniors who meet the above criteria and have permission to take fewer than 12 hours on a graded basis may take\none course on a P/F basis in one of their last two semesters (e.g., a semester in which an internship or student\nteaching is not being taken). If the student does not graduate at the end of the senior year, the grade of P is\nautomatically converted to the grade actually earned. When a student wishes to complete a major or minor in a field\nin which a grade of P has been received, the registrar converts this grade to the regular grade originally earned.\n\nAll P/F students are expected to meet normal course requirements (e.g., reports, papers, examinations, laboratory\nattendance) and are graded in a normal way. At the end of the semester, students enrolled on a P/F basis are\nawarded a regular grade. Any grade of D- or better is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F\ngrade remains as awarded. A student taking a course on a P/F basis must meet the course prerequisites as set forth\nin this catalog.\n\nStudents may submit a Pass/Fail request form on or before the Pass/Fail declaration deadline. Students may change\nfrom a P/F basis to a regularly graded basis until the last day to withdraw from classes in a given term. All Pass/Fail\ndeadlines are published in the Academic Calendar. The Pass/Fail form is available\nonline: peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-offices/oas/downloads.php.\nWithdrawal (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: After the Change Period, and extending to the deadline published on the Undergraduate Academic\nCalendar, a student may withdraw from a course with approval from the student’s adviser. Under certain conditions,\nwithdrawal may also require approval from an associate dean in 350 Buttrick Hall. During the same period students\nmay change their status from P/F to regularly graded or elect Pass/Fail status in a course.\n\nThese changes must be made with a Change of Course form, which is available online and which the student must\nsubmit to the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education in Arts and Science. After the deadline, withdrawal is\npossible only in the most extraordinary circumstances, such as illness or unusual personal or family problems, and in\nall cases must be approved by the Administrative Committee. After the withdrawal deadline, change from P/F to\nregularly graded status is not permitted.\n\nStudents who withdraw from a course after the change period receive the grade W (withdrawal). This grade is not\nused in the computation of the grade point average or class rank. A student who defaults in a course without\ndropping or withdrawing from it receives the grade F.\n\nBlair: A student may withdraw from a course after the official Change Period and prior to the deadline for\n\nPage 63 of 1019\n\n\fwithdrawal published in the University Calendar, generally Friday of the week after mid-semester. A change of\ncourse request form must be signed by the instructor, adviser, and associate dean and filed with the Office of\nAcademic Services. (Students from other schools of the university must file with their home school.) Withdrawals\nafter the published deadline result in an F. The grade W may be assigned by the associate dean to a student who\nseeks to withdraw from a course or from school after the deadline for reasons such as extended illness or unusual\npersonal or family problems. No W grades are calculated in a student’s grade point average.\n\nEngineering: After the Change Period and extending to the deadline published on the Undergraduate Academic\nCalendar, a student may withdraw from a course with approval of the student’s adviser. Under certain conditions,\nwithdrawal may also require approval from the senior associate dean. During the same period students may change\ntheir status from P/F to regularly graded or vice versa. The W is recorded for any course from which a student\nwithdraws. A course in which a W is recorded is not used in figuring grade point averages.\n\nPeabody: The symbol W (withdrawal) is assigned in lieu of a grade when a student formally withdraws from a class\nbefore the published mid-semester deadline. After that point, withdrawal will result in an F. A student who\nwithdraws from school for reasons such as illness, unusual personal or family problems, and the like, may petition\nthe Dean’s Office for an authorized administrative withdrawal. If approved, the student will receive the grade W for\ncourses in progress. A student who withdraws from school without an authorized administrative withdrawal receives\nthe grade W or F depending upon the date of withdrawal. The grade W is not included in the calculation of the grade\npoint average.\nTaking Courses for No Credit (A&S, Blair)\nArts & Science: Students may want to take elsewhere in the university courses that are not creditable toward the\nbachelor’s degree. They may do so on a no-credit basis, attending classes, doing all the work of the course, and\nreceiving a grade that is recorded on the transcript with a notation that it does not count toward the degree.\n\nNo-credit courses count in computation of the student’s academic load and in computation of tuition, but not in\ncomputation of the grade point average. They also do not count toward the attainment of class standing.\n\nBlair: Students who wish to take courses on a no-credit basis must file with the Blair Office of Academic Services\nbefore the end of the Change Period. Students must attend class and complete all course work. A grade is recorded\non the transcript with the notation \"Grading Basis: No Credit Toward Current Degree,\" indicating that it does not\ncount toward the degree.\n\nNo-credit courses count in the computation of a student’s academic load and tuition, but not in the computation of\nthe grade point average.\nAuditing (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: Regularly enrolled Arts and Science students who want to audit courses in any of the\nundergraduate schools of the university must obtain the written consent of the instructor to attend the class but do\nnot register for the course for credit. Forms are available from the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education in each\nschool. No permanent record is kept of the audit. Regular students may audit one class each semester.\n\nBlair: Regularly enrolled Blair students who want to audit courses in any of the undergraduate schools of the\nuniversity must complete the change of course request form and obtain the written consent of the instructor to\nattend the class but do not register for the course for credit. No permanent record is kept of the audit. Regular\nstudents may audit one class each semester.\n\nEngineering: Regularly enrolled students in the School of Engineering who want to audit courses in any of the\nundergraduate schools of the university must get the written consent of the instructor to attend the class and\n\nPage 64 of 1019\n\n\fregister to audit the course. Forms are available from the School of Engineering Office of Academic Services. No\npermanent record is kept of the audit. Regular students may audit one class each semester.\n\nPeabody: Regularly enrolled Peabody College students who want to audit courses in any of the undergraduate\nschools of the university must obtain the written consent of the instructor to attend the class but do not register for\nthe course for credit. Forms are available online: peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-offices/oas/downloads.php. No\npermanent record is kept of the audit. Regular students may audit one class each semester free of charge. In order\nto audit a course, the student must also be enrolled in at least one additional graded credit hour in the same\nsemester.\nIndependent Study (A&S, Blair, PBDY)\nArts & Science: Independent study and directed study courses are intended primarily for students in their junior\nand senior years. Students may not take an independent study or directed study course that duplicates a regular\ncourse being offered in the same semester. Juniors or seniors who wish to take independent study or directed study\ncourses must use the following procedure:\n1. Students may initiate the independent study enrollment process in YES by clicking on the Individual Study link\non the student landing page.\n2. Students must be registered in the independent study before the end of the change period.\nBlair: Students must obtain permission to enroll in Independent Study from the instructor of their choice prior to\nregistration. Independent Study authorization forms are available at blair.vanderbilt.edu/academics. The instructor’s\nsignature on the authorization form indicates a willingness to supervise the Independent Study project. A contract or\nstudy plan, approved by the instructor in consultation with the appropriate department chair and the associate\ndean, must be submitted to the Blair Office of Academic Services by the tenth calendar day after classes begin. If no\nplan is submitted, the student will be dropped from Independent Study. An Independent Study project should result\nin a substantial written report, paper, or lecture/recital. The report, recording, or some physical manifestation of the\nproject should be retained by the instructor. Independent Study projects proposed by students for cross-school\nregistration should be approved through the mechanisms of both schools. Consult associate deans from both\nschools for guidance.\n\nA student may register for a maximum of 3 hours in Independent Study in a semester. A student may count a total\nof 6 hours in Independent Study toward the degree. A faculty member may supervise no more than four students\nper semester in Independent Study projects.\n\nIndependent Study cannot substitute for courses which are part of the curriculum.\n\nPeabody: Independent study courses, ranging from zero to three hours of credit, are listed in the Schedule of\nCourses and are intended for students in their junior and senior years. Students wanting to undertake an\nindependent study must follow these guidelines:\n1. Students must be in academic “good standing” (may not be on probation or Leave of Absence).\n2. Students must arrange the independent study with a Vanderbilt full time faculty member who has agreed to\nsupervise and grade this course.\n3. Students may enroll for up to 3 hours of independent study in one semester.\n4. Students must make a study plan detailing the nature of the project and the amount of credit. The Individual\nLearning/Directed Study contract must be approved by the instructor and the department chair (or the chair’s\ndesignee) by the last day of the change period.\n5. Registration for the course occurs when the completed Individual Learning/Directed Study contract is\nsubmitted to the Peabody Office of Academic Services. Registration for an independent study will not be\nallowed after the change period has ended.\nStudents may not repeat independent study courses for grade replacement.\nMinimum Graded Credit Hours (A&S)\nArts & Science: A course may not be dropped without authorization of the Administrative Committee or an\n\nPage 65 of 1019\n\n\fassociate dean if the student is left with a course load of fewer than 12 credit hours on a regularly graded basis.\nDuplication of Course Content (A&S, PBDY)\nArts & Science: It is the responsibility of the individual student to avoid duplication in whole or in part of the\ncontent of any course counting toward the degree. Such duplication may result in the withdrawal of credit.\n\nPeabody: It is the responsibility of the individual student to avoid duplication in whole or in part of the content of\nany courses offered toward the degree. Such duplication may result in the withdrawal of credit. This policy also\napplies to Advanced Placement credit.\n\nCertain courses (e.g., ensemble, performance instruction, special topics, and directed study) are designated as\nrepeatable as they contain evolving or iteratively new content. These courses may be taken multiple times for\ncredit. If a course can be repeated, the number of credits allowable per semester should not exceed 3 credit hours\nwithout permission.\nRepeated Courses (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: Most courses offered in the College of Arts and Science may be repeated. If a course was failed the\nlast time it was taken, credit is awarded when the course is repeated with a passing grade. If a course was\npreviously passed, no new credit is earned. If a course previously passed is repeated and failed, credit originally\nearned for it is lost. In any case all grades earned are shown on the transcript. Under conditions explained below, the\nmost recent grade in a course replaces the previous grade in determining credit, in computing the grade point\naverage, and in verifying the completion of degree requirements and progress toward the degree.\n\nThe policy of grade replacement applies when all of the conditions below are met.\n1. Failed courses may be repeated until passed; passed courses may be repeated only once.\n2. Exactly the same course (same department and course number) is completed. A repeated First-Year Writing\nSeminar must have the same department and section number but cannot be repeated after completion of the\nsecond semester in residence.\n3. The course is repeated on a regularly graded basis. This limitation applies even if the course was originally\ntaken on a P/F basis.\n4. The course is not one in independent study or directed study.\n5. A non-W course is taken as repeat credit for a Writing version of the same course that was previously passed.\nThe student loses credit for the writing requirement.\n6. A W course is taken as repeat credit for a non-Writing version of the same course that was previously passed.\nThe student earns credit for the writing requirement.\n7. Certain courses (e.g., ensemble, performance instruction, and independent study) are designated as\nrepeatable as they contain evolving or iteratively new content. These courses may be taken multiple times\nfor credit. If a course can be repeated, the number of credit hours allowable per semester will be included in\nthe course description.\nIn some instances, enrollment in a course similar to one already completed but with a different course number will\nresult in the award of no credit for the second course and will have no effect on the grade point average. These are\ndesignated in the departmental course listings.\n\nCourses taken in the College of Arts and Science may not be repeated elsewhere for grade replacement.\n\nStudents are cautioned that while repeating for grade replacement a course previously passed may improve their\ncumulative grade point average, it may also lead to a problem in meeting minimum credit hours requirements for\nclass standing because no new credit is earned.\n\nBlair: Certain courses, notably performing ensembles and variable credit performance instruction, may be taken\n\nPage 66 of 1019\n\n\fmore than once for credit. Otherwise, students may repeat any course to replace a grade, with no additional credit\nhours earned, subject to the following conditions:\nCourses taken at Vanderbilt may not be repeated elsewhere. A grade may not be replaced by a grade of\n“Pass.”\nA grade of W or I cannot replace a letter grade.\nOnly the most recent grade is calculated in the grade point average, but all grades show on the transcript.\nEngineering: Courses in which a student has earned a grade lower than B– may be repeated under certain\nconditions. A course in which the student earned a grade between D– and C+, inclusive, may be repeated only once.\nA course may be repeated only on a graded basis, even if the course was originally taken Pass/Fail. Courses taken\nPass/Fail in which the student earned a Pass may not be repeated. A course cannot be repeated through credit by\nexamination.\n\nStudents should note that repeating a course may improve the grade point average, but it may also lead to\nproblems in meeting minimum hour requirements for class standing and progress toward a degree. Repeating a\ncourse does not increase the number of hours used in calculation of the grade point average. All grades earned will\nbe shown on the transcript, but only the latest grade will be used for computation of grade point averages.\n\nPeabody: If a course is repeated, only the last grade and credit hours earned will be used to calculate the grade\npoint average and be creditable toward graduation. However, the original grade will appear on the transcript.\nCertain courses (e.g., special topics courses, directed study courses; see duplicate content section, below) may be\nrepeated for credit when there is no duplication of content. Such courses may be repeated to replace a grade only\nwhen the content of the original and repeated courses is the same. Courses must be repeated in a graded status.\nThis policy also applies to Advanced Placement credit. Courses taken at Vanderbilt may not be repeated elsewhere\nfor grade replacement, nor may courses taken elsewhere be repeated at Vanderbilt for grade replacement.\nUndergraduate Enrollment in Graduate School Courses (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: In the 4-digit course numbering system some courses may enroll undergraduate and graduate\nstudents simultaneously. Typically, there is a 3000- or 4000-level course for undergraduates and a matching 5000level course for graduate students. Undergraduate students may enroll in the 3000- or 4000-level course of these\npairs without special approval.\n\nA qualified Vanderbilt University senior undergraduate may enroll in courses approved for graduate credit (those\nnumbered 5000 and higher) and receive credit that, upon the student’s admission to the Vanderbilt Graduate\nSchool, may be applicable toward a graduate degree. Vanderbilt cannot guarantee that another graduate school will\ngrant credit for such courses. The principles governing this option are as follows:\n1. Work taken under this option is limited to those courses approved for graduate credit (those numbered 5000\nand higher) and listed as such in the Graduate School catalog, excluding thesis and dissertation research\ncourses and similar individual research and readings courses. Courses approved for professional credit (i.e.,\nmany courses in the Divinity School, Law School, School of Medicine, School of Nursing, and Owen Graduate\nSchool of Management) may not be taken as part of this option.\n2. The student must, at the time of registration, have a 3.00 average in all prior work to be counted toward the\nbachelor’s degree, or a 3.00 average in all prior work to be counted toward the undergraduate major, or a\n3.00 average in the preceding two semesters.\n3. The total course load, including both graduate and undergraduate courses, must not exceed 15 credit hours in\nany semester.\n4. No undergraduate student may enroll in more than one graduate course in any semester.\n5. A registration form for undergraduate Arts and Science students wishing to exercise this option is available in\nthe Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education. The interested student must use this form to obtain the\nwritten approval of the following:\n1. the academic adviser,\n2. the instructor of the course,\n3. and the director of graduate studies of the department or program.\nEngineering: A qualified Vanderbilt junior or senior may enroll in courses approved for graduate credit by the\ngraduate faculty. Credit from such courses may be applied to undergraduate degree requirements or, upon the\nstudent’s admission to the Vanderbilt University Graduate School, toward a graduate degree. Vanderbilt cannot\n\nPage 67 of 1019\n\n\fguarantee that another graduate school will grant credit for such courses. The principles governing this option are\nas follows:\n1. Work taken under this option is limited to courses numbered 5000 and above and listed in the catalog of the\nGraduate School, excluding thesis and dissertation research courses and similar individual research and\nreading courses.\n2. The student must, at the time of registration, have a 3.500 grade point average in the preceding two\nsemesters.\n3. The total course load, graduate and undergraduate courses, must not exceed 18 hours in that semester.\n4. The student must obtain the written approval of their academic adviser and the instructor of the course on a\nform available in the Office of Academic Services.\n5. Permission for Vanderbilt undergraduates to enroll in graduate courses does not constitute a commitment on\nthe part of any program to accept the student as a graduate student in the future.\n6. An undergraduate student exercising this option will be treated as a graduate student with regard to class\nrequirements and grading standards.\nPeabody: All students wishing to take 5000–8000-level courses for either undergraduate or graduate credit must\nobtain the written approval of their academic advisers, the instructor of the course, and the Office of Academic\nServices. Some courses are designed to enroll both undergraduate and graduate/professional students in the same\nclass section. Such courses will typically have two course numbers, one in the graduate range (5000–8000) and one\nin the undergraduate range (usually either 3000– or 4000–level). Unless they wish to take the course for postbaccalaureate credit, undergraduates must register for the course using the undergraduate course number and may\ndo so without any special permission.\nUndergraduates wishing to receive approval for graduate credit in 5000–8000-level courses also see Reserving\nCredit for Graduate School (A&S, PBDY).\nReserving Credit for Graduate School (A&S, PBDY)\nArts & Science:\n1. Arts and Science students who are interested in reserving the credit earned in a graduate course (those\nnumbered 5000 and higher) should consult with the Graduate School before attempting to register for\ngraduate courses under this option.\n2. The work must be in excess of that required for the bachelor’s degree.\n3. All of the above criteria apply under this option.\n4. Students must declare their intention to reserve this credit on the registration form.\n5. Permission for Vanderbilt undergraduates to enroll in graduate courses does not constitute a commitment on\nthe part of any department to accept the student as a graduate student in the future.\n6. An undergraduate student exercising this option is treated as a graduate student with regard to class\nrequirements and grading standards.\nPeabody: A qualified Vanderbilt University senior undergraduate may enroll in courses approved for postbaccalaureate credit and receive credit which, upon the student’s admission into a Peabody College professional\nprogram, may be applicable toward the professional degree. The principles governing this option are as follows:\n1. Work taken under this option is limited to those 5000–8000-level courses approved for post-baccalaureate\ncredit, excluding thesis and dissertation research courses and similar individual research and readings\ncourses.\n2. Such work must be in excess of that required for the bachelor’s degree.\n3. At the time of registration, the student must have a B average in all prior work to be counted toward the\nbachelor’s degree, or a B average in all prior work to be counted toward the undergraduate major, or\na B average in the preceding two semesters.\n4. Undergraduate students wishing to count for post-baccalaureate credit courses taken under this option must\nconsult the instructor of each course and must, at the time of registration, declare their intention on a form\navailable at the Office of Academic Services.\n5. The student’s total course load (graduate plus undergraduate courses) must not exceed 15 hours during any\nsemester in which graduate credit is pursued.\n6. Permission for Vanderbilt undergraduates to enroll in post-baccalaureate courses does not constitute a\ncommitment on the part of any department to accept the student in the future. Courses taken under this\noption are subject to departmental approval before they may be included on post-baccalaureate programs of\nstudy.\n7. An undergraduate student exercising this option will be treated as a post-baccalaureate student with regard\nto class requirements and grading standards.\n\nPage 68 of 1019\n\n\fInterested students should consult the Peabody Office of Academic Services to verify their eligibility as defined\nabove before attempting to register for post-baccalaureate course work under this option.\n\nGrading and Credits\nResidence Requirement (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nAdvanced Placement (Blair)\nCredit Hour Definition (Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nGrading System (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nGrade Reports (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nGrade Point Average (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nDefined Grades with Corresponding Grade Points per Credit Hour (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nF: Failure (A&S, VUSE)\nGrade Appeals (PBDY)\nMid-Semester Progress Reports (A&S)\nDeficiency Notices (Blair)\nTemporary Grades (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nTransfer Credit (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nSummer or Winter Work at Another Institution (A&S)\nCredit by Examination (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nResidence Requirement (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: A minimum of four normal semesters (at least 60 credit hours), including the last two semesters\n(at least 30 credit hours), must be spent in residence in the College of Arts and Science unless an exception is made\nby the Administrative Committee. Students transferring from other schools of the university must spend the last\nyear (at least 30 credit hours) in residence in the College of Arts and Science.\n\nBlair: A minimum of four semesters and at least 63 credit hours, as well as the last two semesters and the last 30\ncredit hours, must be spent in residence in the Blair School. Students transferring from other schools of the\nuniversity must spend the last two semesters and at least the last 30 credit hours in residence in the Blair School.\nStudents who wish to study abroad or study away in their penultimate semester may petition the Blair Curriculum\nCommittee for a waiver of the residence requirement.\n\nEngineering: A minimum of four semesters including the last two semesters must be spent in residence in the\nSchool of Engineering. A student in the School of Engineering is considered “in residence” if the student is (a)\nphysically present at Vanderbilt and enrolled in Vanderbilt University classes offered on campus, or (b) enrolled in\nat least 12 credit hours in an approved Vanderbilt study abroad program. During these four or more semesters, the\nstudent must have completed at least 60 semester hours of an approved curriculum in one of the degree programs.\n\nPeabody: Students must complete a minimum of 60 hours in residence at Vanderbilt including the final two\nsemesters.\nAdvanced Placement (Blair)\nBlair: Advanced Placement with Credit. Advanced placement with credit is granted in a number of areas (see the\nchapter on Admission).\n\nPage 69 of 1019\n\n\fAdvanced Placement without Credit. Students may be admitted to advanced music courses on the basis of\nplacement tests at Blair, but no credit is awarded for music courses exempted.\nCredit Hour Definition (Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nBlair/Engineering/Peabody: Credit hours are semester hours; e.g., a three-hour course carries credit of three\nsemester hours. One semester credit hour represents at least three hours of academic work per week, on average,\nfor one semester. Academic work includes, but is not necessarily limited to, lectures, laboratory work, homework,\nresearch, class readings, independent study, internships, practica, studio work, recitals, practicing, rehearsing, and\nrecitations. Some Vanderbilt courses may have requirements which exceed this definition. Certain courses (e.g.,\ndissertation research, ensemble, performance instruction, and independent study) are designated as repeatable as\nthey contain evolving or iteratively new content. These courses may be taken multiple times for credit. If a course\ncan be repeated, the number of credits allowable per semester will be included in the course description.\nGrading System (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science:\n\nA: excellent\nB: good\nC: satisfactory\nD: minimum pass work\nF: failure\n\nUnder certain circumstances the following grades may be awarded:\n\nW: withdrawal\nP: (see P/F Course Provision)\nM: absent from final examination\nI: incomplete in some requirement other than final examination\nIP: first semester grade for two-semester Honors sequence\n\nPlus and minus modifiers may be associated with letter grades A through D as shown in the table below.

A student who\nwithdraws from a course before the date given in the Academic Calendar is given the grade W. A student may not\nwithdraw from a course after that date.\n\nPeabody:\nPeabody College undergraduate students are on a four-point grading system. All work is graded by letters,\ninterpreted as follows:\n\nA:\n\nexcellent\n\nB:\n\ngood\n\nC:\n\nsatisfactory\n\nD:\n\nminimum pass work\n\nF:\n\nfailure\n\nUnder certain circumstances the following grades may be awarded:\n\nW:\n\nwithdrawal\n\nP:\n\npass (see Pass/D/Fail course provision)\n\nM:\n\nmissed final examination\n\nI:\n\nincomplete in some requirement other than final examination\n\nPlus and minus modifiers may be associated with the letters A through D as shown in the table below. Grade point\naverages are calculated using indicated grade point values.\nGrade Reports (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nArts & Science: Students have access to their grade reports on the Academic Record in YES. Notifications are sent\n\nPage 71 of 1019\n\n\fto students in their last two semesters, showing total credit hours, grade point average, and degree requirements\nstill to be met. Students should examine their Degree Audit carefully and discuss it with their advisers. Any errors\nshould be reported immediately to the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education. A grade reported and recorded in\nthe Office of the University Registrar may be changed only upon request of the instructor with the approval of the\nAdministrative Committee. The committee will approve such a change only on certification that the original report\nwas in error.\n\nBlair: Grade reports and faculty critiques of performance examinations will be provided to students as soon as\npossible at the end of each semester. Grades are available online in the Academic Record, which is housed within\nYES (Your Enrollment Services) at yes.vanderbilt.edu. Occasionally, student academic information may be shared\nwith appropriate faculty committees for purposes of promotion and tenure review.\n\nA grade reported and recorded in the Office of the University Registrar may be changed only upon written request of\nthe instructor, on certification that the original report was in error, with approval of the associate dean.\n\nEngineering: A grade report will be available to the student on Academic Record in YES as soon as possible after\nthe conclusion of each semester. This report will give the total hours and grade points earned during the semester,\nas well as the cumulative hours and grade points earned through that semester. Students should examine these\nreports carefully and discuss them with their faculty advisers. Any errors should be reported immediately to the\nOffice of Academic Services of the School of Engineering.\n\nA grade reported and recorded in the Office of the University Registrar may be changed only upon written request of\nthe instructor and with approval of the Administrative Committee. The committee will approve such a change only\non certification that the original report was in error.\nGrade Point Average (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: A student’s grade point average is obtained by dividing the quality points earned by the credit\nhours for which the student has registered, excluding courses taken for no credit, those from which the student has\nofficially withdrawn (see Withdrawal Period under Registration above), and those completed with the grade P.\n\nIn no case is the grade point average affected by transfer credit. No course at another institution in which a grade\nbelow C– was received, or which was taken on a Pass/Fail basis, is credited toward the degrees awarded by the\nCollege of Arts and Science.\n\nBlair: A student’s grade point average is obtained by dividing the total grade points earned by the number of hours\nfor which the student registered, excluding courses audited or taken for no credit, those from which the student has\nwithdrawn or for which an incomplete grade (I or M) has been authorized, and those with the grade Pass.\n\nEngineering: A student’s grade point average is obtained by dividing the total grade points earned by the number\nof hours for which the student registered, excluding courses taken for no credit, those from which the student has\nwithdrawn, those with the temporary grade of I or M, those taken in a study abroad program, and those that are\ncompleted with the grade Pass.\n\nPeabody: A student’s grade point average is obtained by dividing the grade points earned by the hours for which\nthe student has registered, excluding courses taken for no credit, those from which the student has withdrawn, and\nthose that are completed with the grade P.\nDefined Grades with Corresponding Grade Points per Credit Hour (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science:\n\nPage 72 of 1019\n\n\fA\n\n4.0\n\nC\n\n2.0\n\nA-\n\n3.7\n\nC-\n\n1.7\n\nB+\n\n3.3\n\nD+\n\n1.3\n\nB\n\n3.0\n\nD\n\n1.0\n\nB-\n\n2.7\n\nD-\n\n0.7\n\nC+\n\n2.3\n\nF\n\n0.0\n\nA\n\n4.0\n\nC\n\n2.0\n\nA-\n\n3.7\n\nC-\n\n1.7\n\nB+\n\n3.3\n\nD+\n\n1.3\n\nB\n\n3.0\n\nD\n\n1.0\n\nB-\n\n2.7\n\nD-\n\n0.7\n\nC+\n\n2.3\n\nF\n\n0.0\n\nBlair:\n\nEngineering:\n\nA+\n\n4.0\n\nC+\n\n2.3\n\nA\n\n4.0\n\nC\n\n2.0\n\nA-\n\n3.7\n\nC-\n\n1.7\n\nB+\n\n3.3\n\nD+\n\n1.3\n\nB\n\n3.0\n\nD\n\n1.0\n\nB-\n\n2.7\n\nD-\n\n0.7\n\nF\n\n0.0\n\nPeabody:\n\nA\n\n4.0\n\nC\n\n2.0\n\nA-\n\n3.7\n\nC-\n\n1.7\n\nB+\n\n3.3\n\nD+\n\n1.3\n\nB\n\n3.0\n\nD\n\n1.0\n\nB-\n\n2.7\n\nD-\n\n0.7\n\nC+\n\n2.3\n\nF\n\n0.0\n\nF: Failure (A&S, VUSE)\nArts & Science: The grade F indicates failure. All F’s are counted in the computation of grade point averages,\nexcept when a course is repeated and is subsequently passed. In this case the latest grade is used for computation\nof the grade point average (but the grade originally earned is not removed from the transcript). A course in which\nthe grade F is received must be repeated as a regular course if credit is to be given. It may not be repeated as a\ncourse in independent or directed study, under the procedures for credit by examination, or on a P/F basis.\n\nEngineering: A subject in which the grade F is received must be taken again in class before credit is given. A\nstudent who deserts a course without following the correct procedure for withdrawing from it will receive an F in the\ncourse.\n\nPage 73 of 1019\n\n\fGrade Appeals (PBDY)\nPeabody: A student who believes they have received an inappropriate final grade in a class can appeal that grade\nif they believe the grade is inappropriate for at least one of the following reasons:\n1. The student is held to different standards than other students in the course.\n2. The instructor in determining the final grade applied standards that departed from those outlined in the\ncourse syllabus.\n3. The student believes that there is a clerical error in the calculation or reporting of the grade.\n4. The instructor did not adequately consider the student’s needs for officially sanctioned and communicated\naccommodations.\nUltimately, the grade can be appealed following the academic appeals process outlined for more general academic\nmatters, directly above. However, several steps to attempt to resolve the grade should be taken, in turn, before an\nappeal is submitted to the Undergraduate Administrative Committee (UAC).\n\nFirst, students and instructors are encouraged to resolve grade disputes informally. If an informal process fails, the\nstudent may formally appeal a final course grade by contacting the instructor in writing within ten (10) business\ndays after the start of the following semester. The student’s written appeal must include the grounds for the appeal\n(see conditions 1 through 4 listed above), the change in grade that is being requested, and evidence to support the\nstudent’s case for a grade change. The instructor must inform the student of his/her decision in writing.\n\nSecond, if the student does not feel the matter has been resolved satisfactorily with the instructor, the student may\npetition the director of undergraduate studies in the department where the course is housed. The petition for\nreviewing the appeal must include the original written appeal, the instructor’s written response, and the reason why\nthe student is dissatisfied with the instructor’s decision. The DUS will review the materials and assess the merits of\nthe case. If the DUS finds no basis for the grievance, the petition will be dismissed and the student will be notified in\nwriting. If the DUS determines that the grievance has merit, the DUS will work with the parties to seek a resolution. If\nthe DUS is the course instructor, the student may directly petition the department chair in which the course is\nhoused.\n\nThird, if the case is dismissed by the DUS, and the student does not agree with the grounds for the decision, the\nstudent may petition the chair of the department where the course is housed. The student is responsible for\nproviding the department chair with relevant case documentation, including the original written appeal, the written\nresponses of both the instructor and the DUS, and an explanation as to why the student is dissatisfied with the DUS’s\ndecision to dismiss the case. The department chair will decide the merits of the case and provide written\ndocumentation to all parties as to the decision. If the case is determined to have merit, the department chair will\nseek a resolution among the parties involved, including the student, the instructor, and the DUS. If the department\nchair is the course instructor, the student may appeal the DUS’s decision directly to the Undergraduate\nAdministrative Committee using the more general academic appeals process outlined in the previous Appeals\nsection.\n\nFourth, if the case is dismissed by the department chair and the student does not agree with the grounds for the\ndecision, the student may appeal the department chair’s decision to the Undergraduate Administrative Committee\nusing the more general academic appeals process outlined in the previous Appeals section.\nMid-Semester Progress Reports (A&S)\nArts & Science: At the end of the seventh week of each semester, instructors assess the progress of all students in\ntheir classes and report those whose work at that point is deficient or whose work is being harmed by excessive\nabsences. Grades to be reported are C–, D+, D, D–, F, and I (for incomplete, meaning that some work due by that\npoint has not been submitted). Instructors may combine with one of these grades or assign separately a notation of\nexcessive absences from a class. Reports of these deficiencies are posted in the Academic Record application in\nYES. Grades given at mid-semester do not become part of the permanent record but are intended to warn students\nabout performance judged unsatisfactory.\nDeficiency Notices (Blair)\n\nPage 74 of 1019\n\n\fBlair: During the week after mid-semester, the Office of the University Registrar posts deficiency notices for\nstudents whose mid-semester grade in any course is a C– or below or whose work is incomplete ( I ). (Deficiency\nnotices are found in the Academic Detail in YES at yes.vanderbilt.edu.) Deficiencies are issued as a matter of\ninformation and warning. Deficiencies do not show on transcripts, but information is sent to the faculty advisers and\nmay be sent to parents of those students who have submitted a FERPA Release form indicating permission to\nrelease academic information to specific individuals.\n\nA student who receives a deficiency notice is required to meet with the faculty adviser before the deadline for\nwithdrawal at the end of the week. A student with deficiencies in two or more courses or any senior who receives a\ndeficiency notice is also required to meet with the associate dean before the deadline for withdrawal (usually Friday\nof the week after mid-semester).\nTemporary Grades (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science, Blair, Engineering, Peabody: Temporary grades are placeholders that are assigned under\ndefined circumstances and are not replacements for failing grades. Missing work must be completed by the deadline\nspecified by the instructor (usually before the end of the second week of classes in the next regular term but no\nlater than the end of the following semester) after which the permanent grade is recorded (either the newly\nassigned or default grade). The default grade is calculated by assigning zero points for work not submitted.\nTemporary grades are not calculated in the GPA, but a student who receives a temporary grade is ineligible for the\nDean's List. An undergraduate student cannot graduate with any temporary grades on their record.\nThe following temporary grades are available\n\nI: Incomplete\n\nTo be assigned only if the following conditions apply:\n1. An extenuating circumstance has emerged after the course withdrawal deadline\n2. The student is up to date on all work prior to the extenuating circumstance\n3. The student successfully completed at least 60% of the assigned work throughout the semester\n4. The student requests the incomplete before the end of classes\n5. The student has been attending a significant majority of the classes\n\nM: Missed Final Examination or Final Evaluation\n\nTo be assigned only if the following conditions apply:\n1. The student misses only the final examination or final evaluation and promptly informs the instructor as to\nthe extenuating circumstances for missing the final exam/evaluation. In the absence of prompt notification of\nextenuating circumstances, a grade of zero for the final exam/evaluation is recorded.\n2. The student could pass the course if the final examination is successfully completed. (The grade of F is given\nif the student could not pass the course even with the final examination.)\nTransfer Credit (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: It is the student’s responsibility to provide all of the information required by the Office of the\nUniversity Registrar to assess the program for which transfer of credit is requested. Work presented for transfer\nmust be from a regionally accredited college and is subject to evaluation in light of the degree requirements of the\nCollege of Arts and Science. Credit will not be awarded for independent study, physical education, or dance\nperformance courses.\n\nWork transferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average. No course in\nwhich a grade below C– was received, or which was taken on a Pass/Fail basis, will be credited toward a degree\noffered by the College of Arts and Science. The question of credit in the College of Arts and Science for previous\n\nPage 75 of 1019\n\n\fwork done at another institution must be settled in advance of the student’s first registration.\n\nTransfer students must spend at least four full semesters, including the last two semesters, enrolled in the College\nof Arts and Science. They must earn at least 60 credit hours and complete at least one writing course in fulfillment\nof the writing requirement while so enrolled.\n\nBlair: Transfer courses are often taken as free electives, but they may also earn liberal arts core credit. They may\nnot fulfill the music core requirements, count as part of the last 30 hours of residence, serve as repeat credit, or be\ntaken on a Pass/Fail basis. Work transferred from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average. No\ncourse in which a grade below C– was received will be credited toward the B.Mus. or B.Mus.Arts. It is the student’s\nresponsibility to provide all of the information required by the Office of the University Registrar to assess the\nprogram for which transfer of credit is requested. Work presented for transfer must be from a regionally accredited\ncollege or university. Information on the evaluation process and policies is available\nat registrar.vanderbilt.edu/transfer-credit.\n\nSummer studies. Students enrolled at Blair may receive transfer credit for summer courses taken at another\nregionally accredited two-year or four-year college or university. This may include work at festivals or camps, if\noffered through a regionally accredited institution. To qualify for summer credit, a student must be in good standing,\nconsult the Office of Academic Services, and submit courses for evaluation through the Transfer Credit portal in YES.\nA detailed course syllabus is required in order for a course to be evaluated. Deadline for pre- approval is April 1.\n\nSemester work at another institution. Students wanting to receive transfer credit for a semester of work at another\nregionally accredited institution must receive approval in advance from the associate dean. To qualify for such\ncredit, the student must be in good standing and must present a plan that makes clear the educational rationale for\nsuch work, the ways in which it supplements the Vanderbilt curriculum, and the equivalence of standards to those at\nVanderbilt. Approval of the overall plan must be followed by approval of specific courses by the associate dean and\nsubmission of courses through the transfer credit evaluation process in YES. A detailed course syllabus is required in\norder for a course to be evaluated. Students enrolled full time (i.e., carrying at least 12 credit hours) during a regular\n(fall or spring) semester are assumed to be engaged in full-time study at Vanderbilt. Such students are not\npermitted to take additional course work elsewhere, for transfer credit, during the semester. This includes online\ncourses as well as courses offered by nearby institutions.\n\nEngineering: Work that a student contemplates taking at a college or university other than Vanderbilt after\nmatriculating to VU is treated as transfer work and must be approved in advance in writing through the YES Transfer\nCredit application. The institution must have appropriate regional accreditation. It is the student’s responsibility to\nprovide all information needed for an assessment of the program and course(s) for which transfer credit is\nrequested. Students must upload a detailed syllabus, which then must be approved by the Office of the University\nRegistrar, the relevant Vanderbilt University department, and the School of Engineering Dean’s Office. Work\ntransferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not be included in the Vanderbilt grade point average. No\ntransfer credit course in which a grade below C- was earned or that was taken after the start of the penultimate\nVanderbilt semester will be credited toward a degree offered by the School of Engineering. A course a student has\ntaken at Vanderbilt may not be repeated in another institution to obtain a higher grade or to obtain credit. Students\nwho have been dismissed from Vanderbilt and subsequently return to Vanderbilt are not eligible to receive transfer\ncredit for any classes taken during the period of dismissal. Students cannot take courses for transfer credit at or\nthrough another institution while simultaneously enrolled in a semester at Vanderbilt unless authorized in advance\nby the School’s Administrative Committee.\n\nPeabody: Students who transfer from another institution must have a final transcript sent directly to the\nUndergraduate Admissions Office, Vanderbilt University. Upon acceptance, students will be asked to submit course\ndescriptions and syllabi for all proposed transfer credit. Upon acceptance, courses will be evaluated by Vanderbilt to\ndetermine which courses will transfer and which requirements (e.g., Liberal Education Core, professional core) are\nmet by the transfer courses. No course for which a student received the grade D+ or lower will transfer. Course\nwork transferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average.\n\nPage 76 of 1019\n\n\fTransfer students must complete at least 60 hours of work at Vanderbilt. Two of the four semesters in residence\nmust be the last two semesters of the student’s degree program.\n\nPeabody students who wish to take course work during the summer, or during an academic-year semester, at a\nregionally accredited two-year or four-year college or university and transfer up to 12 hours to Vanderbilt must be in\ngood standing with at least a C average. Prior approval must be granted for all courses to be taken elsewhere. If the\ncourses are to be taken during the academic year, the student must take a personal leave explicitly approved for\nthis purpose by the Peabody Dean’s Office. Students on leave for other reasons (e.g., medical or other personal\nreasons) cannot take course work elsewhere for transfer credit without prior permission. Course work transferred to\nVanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average.\n\nRequests to participate in non-Vanderbilt-approved overseas programs for transfer credit will be approved only\nunder exceptional circumstances in which the proposed program represents a truly unique and unusual educational\nopportunity. To apply for approval, the student should complete the transfer of credit application and apply for a\nleave of absence for the relevant semester. The student must be in good standing with at least a 2.700 grade point\naverage as of the date of application, and approval must be granted in advance of the study overseas. Petitions for\nleaves of this type must be filed at least one month before the close of the preceding semester, and final approval\nof such petitions always rests with the dean’s office. It should be noted, however, that if a program has been\napproved by Vanderbilt, students must enroll in the program via the Global Education Office. In no case, after\nmatriculating at Vanderbilt, may a student apply to participate in an approved program for transfer credit through a\ndifferent university, or through an external agency, and then seek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt.\n\nStudents enrolled full time (i.e., carrying at least 12 credit hours) during a regular (fall or spring) semester are\nassumed to be engaged in full-time study at Vanderbilt. Such students are not permitted to take additional course\nwork elsewhere, for transfer credit, during the semester. This includes online courses, as well as courses offered by\nnearby institutions.\nSummer or Winter Work at Another Institution (A&S)\nArts & Science: Students enrolled in the College of Arts and Science may receive transfer credit for a maximum of\ntwo courses taken during summer or winter at a regionally-accredited institution. To qualify for such credit, the\nstudent must be in good academic standing and must obtain prior authorization from the appropriate department\nby submitting courses through the Transfer Credit Submission application in YES. A detailed course syllabus is\nrequired in order for a course to be evaluated. Such courses cannot fulfill AXLE requirements, count as part of the\nlast 30 credit hours in residence, duplicate a course taken previously, or be taken on a Pass/Fail or similar basis.\nStudents cannot transfer credit for summer or winter work from outside of the country of their permanent home\naddress.\nCredit by Examination (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: In certain circumstances, students may be awarded course credit by departmental examination.\n(This procedure is distinct from the award of credit through the College Board Advanced Placement Tests taken prior\nto the student’s first enrollment.)\n\nStudents who wish to earn credit by departmental examination should consult the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate\nEducation in Arts and Science concerning procedures. To be eligible, students must be carrying a minimum of 12\ncredit hours and be in good standing.\n\nStudents must obtain the approval of the chair of the department that is to give the examination and the instructor\ndesignated by the chair. Students may earn up to 18 hours of credit by any combination of credit through advanced\nplacement examinations and credit by departmental examination. Students may earn up to 8 hours of credit by\nexamination in any one department. Students may attempt to obtain credit by examination no more than twice in\none semester, no more than once in one course in one semester, and no more than twice in one course. Students\nmay not repeat a course for grade replacement under the credit by examination procedures. Credits earned by\n\nPage 77 of 1019\n\n\fcredit by examination may not be counted toward AXLE.\n\nCredit hours and grade are awarded on the basis of the grade earned on the examination, subject to the policy of\nthe department awarding credit. Students have the option of refusing to accept the credit hours and grade after\nlearning the results of the examination.\n\nStudents enrolled for at least 12 credit hours are not charged extra tuition for hours earned through credit by\nexamination, so long as the amount of credit falls within the allowable limits of an 18-hour tuition load, including nocredit courses and courses dropped after the Change Period. Students in this category must pay a $50 fee for the\ncost of constructing, administering, and grading the examination. Since this cost has already been incurred,\nstudents who refuse the credit hours and grade are charged the $50 fee nevertheless.\n\nFull-time students with a tuition load exceeding 18 credit hours and students taking fewer than 12 credit hours pay\ntuition at the regular rate with no additional fee.\n\nBlair: In certain circumstances, students may be awarded course credit (a maximum of 8 hours) by departmental\nexamination. This procedure is distinct from the awarding of credit through the College Board Advanced Placement\nTests or the International Baccalaureate. Students apply for credit by examination through the Blair Office of\nAcademic Services.\n\nTo earn credit by departmental examination, students must be enrolled for at least 12 hours, be in good standing,\nbe recommended by their advisers, and have the approval of the appropriate department. In addition, students\nmust seek prior approval of their study plan through the associate dean’s office. Students may attempt to earn\ncredit by examination in no more than two courses in one semester, only once in any course in one semester, and\nno more than twice in the same course.\n\nCredit hours and grade are awarded on the basis of the grade earned on the examination, subject to the policy of\nthe department awarding credit.

Since this cost has already been incurred, students who\nrefuse the credit hours and grade are charged the $50 fee nevertheless. Full-time students with a tuition load\nexceeding 18 hours and students taking fewer than 12 hours pay tuition at the regular rate, per credit hour, with no\nadditional fee.\n\nEngineering: In certain circumstances students may be awarded course credit by departmental examination. (This\nprocedure is distinct from the award of credit through the College Board Advanced Placement or International\nBaccalaureate Examinations, taken prior to a student’s first enrollment at Vanderbilt or another college.)\n\nStudents who want to earn credit by departmental examination should consult the associate dean concerning\nprocedures. To be eligible, students must be in good standing.\n\nStudents must obtain the approval of the chair of the department that is to give the examination and of the\ninstructor designated by the chair.

If graduation requirements\nchange during the time students are in school, they may elect to be bound by the requirements published in the\ncatalog in any year during their undergraduate academic career at Vanderbilt.\nGrade Point Average Requirements (VUSE)\nEngineering: To be eligible for graduation, a student must have successfully completed all degree requirements\nand shall have earned a minimum grade point average of 2.000 in (a) all courses taken, (b) courses taken within the\nSchool of Engineering, and (c) department courses of each major.\nGraduation Requirements (Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nBlair: Candidates for degrees must have completed 126 hours and all curriculum requirements, have passed all\nprescribed examinations, and be free of indebtedness to the university.\n\nExceptions to stated degree requirements and procedures must be approved by the Curriculum Committee as the\nrepresentative body of the faculty in matters pertaining to the curriculum.\n\nThe minimum grade point averages required for graduation are 2.0 overall and 2.0 in music. A student taking a\nsecond major must earn a 2.0 in that major in order for it to be certified on the transcript.\n\nIf requirements for graduation change, students may elect to be bound by requirements published in\nthe Undergraduate Catalog in either their entering or their graduating year.\n\nEngineering: The specific course requirements and total hours required for the bachelor’s degree vary with the\nstudent’s major program. Detailed requirements for each program are shown in the specimen curricula in the\nCourses of Study section.\n\nPeabody: The specific course requirements and total hours required for the bachelor’s degree vary with the\nstudent’s major program. Detailed requirements for each program are shown in the specimen curricula in the\nCourses of Study section.\nScholarship Student Requirements (Blair, VUSE)\nBlair: Students receiving honor scholarships through Blair School of Music must be enrolled full time, taking all\nassigned music courses, must qualify for class standing, and must maintain each semester minimum grade point\naverages of 2.0 overall and 2.7 in music. Students receiving the Cornelius Vanderbilt Honor Scholarship must\nmaintain a minimum 3.0 grade point average overall and 3.0 in music each year. Additional requirements may be\nstipulated in scholarship award letters.\n\nHonor scholarship awards are considered for renewal annually. Student work will be reviewed at the end of spring\nsemester for possible renewal for the following academic year. Temporary grades may adversely affect renewal. A\nstudent who falls short of the requirements will normally have the scholarship for one semester of grace, after\nwhich, if requirements are still not met, the scholarship will be lost.\n\nPage 80 of 1019\n\n\fStudents receiving scholarships or grants as part of their financial aid packages (not honor scholarships) must\nqualify for class standing in order to be considered for renewal each year. Students receiving federal aid are\nexpected to make satisfactory academic progress as outlined in the chapter on Financial Information.\n\nEngineering: Those students having honor scholarships are expected to maintain a 3.000 grade point average\nwhile taking a minimum of 12 hours. Failure to maintain a 3.000 grade point average each year will result in the\ncancellation of the scholarship.\nLiberal Education Core Guidelines (PBDY)\nPeabody: Applicants to Peabody College will be required to take the SAT I or ACT writing test and the SAT II\nmathematics test. Students with majors in human and organizational development, cognitive studies, child studies,\nor child development do not need the SAT II mathematics test. For applicants applying for Fall 2022 entry,\nVanderbilt is test optional. Scores from the ACT or SAT are not required to be considered for admission. Applicants\nwho want their test scores to be considered may self-report them on the application or may have official scores sent\nto Vanderbilt by the testing agency. Official test scores are required for students who applied with testing and who\nwere admitted and enroll.\n\nThe following application of these scores will be made to the Peabody Liberal Education Core:\n\nWriting Requirement\n\nBefore graduation, all Peabody students must successfully complete two writing courses and credit for the ENGL\n1100s. Writing-intensive courses either have a “W” after the course number (A&S courses) or end with the digit \"7\"\n(Peabody courses).\n\nTo earn credit for ENGL 1100, students must complete one of the following:\nEnglish 1100\nSAT: Combined score of at least 1220 on the Writing and Critical Reasoning sections, with a minimum score of\n500 on each (test taken prior to March 2016).\nSAT: Score of at least 660 on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section, with a minimum score of 27\non the Reading section and a minimum score of 28 on the Writing and Language section (test taken March\n2016 or later).\nACT: Score of at least 27 on the English portion combined with a minimum score of 7 on the Writing portion\n(test taken prior to September 2015).\nACT: Score of at least 27 on the English portion combined with a minimum score of 19 on the Writing portion\n(test taken between September 2015 and September 2016).\nACT: Score of at least 30 on the English portion.\nAP: Minimum score of 4 on the English Language or English Literature exam.\nIB: Minimum score of 6 on the Higher level English A Literature or the Higher Level English A Language &\nLiterature exam.\nMinimum score of 62 on the Tailwind Writing Skill and Reading Comprehension Proficiency Exam.\nFirst-year seminars (courses labeled 1111) offered through the College of Arts and Science and Blair School of Music\nmay count as writing-intensive courses. Peabody freshmen may register for first-year seminars when open\nregistration begins if there are available seats in the course not reserved for Arts and Science students or Blair\nstudents. Peabody students are not required to take a First-year Writing Seminar.\n\nMathematics\n\nPage 81 of 1019\n\n\fStudents with first majors in elementary, secondary, or special education with an SAT II Mathematics test score at or\nabove 620 (Level I) or at or above 570 (Level II) are exempt from three hours of the math component of the Liberal\nEducation Core mathematics category. Students with an exemption must take an additional three credit hours in\ntheir Liberal Education Core elective category to have the minimum required sixty-hour core. Students must take a\nstatistics course if required for their major.\n\nStudents with first majors in child development, child studies, cognitive studies, or human and organizational\ndevelopment must take six hours as stated in the Liberal Education Core mathematics category.\nProgress Evaluation (PBDY)\nPeabody: Students enrolled in Peabody College are expected to satisfy most Liberal Education Core requirements\nduring the freshman and sophomore years. Although legitimate circumstances sometimes force the postponement\nof Liberal Education Core requirements, upper-level students are not expected to have a significant number of\nLiberal Education Core requirements outstanding. A student who, in the opinion of the faculty adviser, the\ndepartment chair, or the associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs, is not making satisfactory progress\ntoward meeting Liberal Education Core or other degree requirements may be reported to the Undergraduate\nAdministrative Committee and is subject to being placed on academic probation by that committee. Students placed\non academic probation for failure to make satisfactory progress toward a degree must remove the deficiency in the\nmanner specified by the Administrative Committee.\nWriting Portfolio (Blair)\nBlair: Students in their senior year are required to submit a writing portfolio drawn from academic course work from\none or more classes to be evaluated by a faculty committee. Emphasis should be placed on demonstrating an\nability to write clearly and effectively and on the student’s ability to form connections across two or more\ndisciplines. Students are required to prepare a one-paragraph narrative explaining how the submitted work\ndemonstrates the required competencies.\nDegree Audit Reports (Blair)\nBlair: An online degree audit is available on YES to all Blair students, showing total hours earned, degree\nrequirements completed, and those still to be met. Students should examine the audit carefully with their faculty\nadvisers. Problems or suspected errors should be discussed immediately with the Blair Office of Academic Services.\nDeclaring of Major and of Second Major (PBDY)\nPeabody: Peabody students declare a major as part of the application process prior to admission. In their first\nsemester, Peabody freshmen are expected to take course work recommended for the major into which they were\nadmitted. Students wishing to change into a different major within Peabody cannot declare this change until March\nof their first year. Second majors must be declared no later than the second semester of the sophomore year. Also,\nduring the sophomore year, students majoring in secondary education and special education will be required to\ndeclare their area of specialization or track.\nOverlap in Course Work between Multiple Majors and Minors (PBDY)\nPeabody: Students pursuing multiple majors and/or optional minors are limited in the amount of course work that\ncan be shared across their major and minor programs of study. If the major or minor is offered through a school\nother than Peabody, the amount of course work that can be shared between that major or minor and other majors or\nminors is determined by that school’s policies. For a major offered through Peabody College, at least 21 credit hours\nneed to be unique to that major. That is, 21 hours within the major cannot be used to count toward any other major\nor minor. For a minor offered through Peabody College, at least 15 hours need to be unique to that minor. Students\nin the School of Engineering may use courses taken in Peabody College for relevant second majors even if those\ncourses also fulfill a School of Engineering degree requirement.\nClass Standing (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: The Administrative Committee determines how many semesters will be allowed for each part-time\nstudent to attain sophomore, junior, or senior standing.\n\nPage 82 of 1019\n\n\fThe internal record of a student dropped from the university under these regulations shows the notation “Failed to\nqualify for class standing.”\n\nSophomore Standing\n\nA student qualifies for sophomore standing upon completion of 24 credit hours of work with a grade point average of\nat least 1.800, completion of two regular semesters (fall or spring), and completion of the first-year writing\nrequirement: successful completion of English 1100 if required and successful completion of a First-Year Writing\nSeminar (numbered 1111 in various disciplines). First-year students who fail to qualify for sophomore standing in\ntwo semesters are placed on probation and must have the permission of the Administrative Committee to register\nfor a third semester. The third semester must be the summer semester at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who do\nnot qualify for sophomore standing during this third semester are dropped from the university.\n\nJunior Standing\n\nA student qualifies for junior standing upon completion of 54 credit hours of work with a grade point average of\n1.900, completion of four regular semesters (fall or spring), and completion of a W course at any level (other than\nENGL 1100 or a First-Year Writing Seminar). Sophomores who fail to qualify for junior standing within two semesters\nafter qualifying for sophomore standing are placed on probation and must have the permission of the Administrative\nCommittee to register for another semester. This additional semester must be the summer semester at Vanderbilt.\nNormally, students who do not qualify for junior standing in this additional semester are dropped from the\nuniversity.\n\nSenior Standing\n\nA student qualifies for senior standing upon completion of 84 credit hours of work with a grade point average of\n2.000 and completion of six regular semesters (fall or spring). Juniors who fail to qualify for senior standing within\ntwo semesters after qualifying for junior standing are placed on probation and must have the permission of the\nAdministrative Committee to register for another semester. This additional semester must be the summer semester\nat Vanderbilt. Normally, students who do not qualify for senior standing in this additional semester are dropped\nfrom the university.\n\nSeniors who fail to maintain a minimum grade point average of 2.000 are placed on probation and must have the\npermission of the Administrative Committee to register for another semester.\n\nBlair: To qualify for sophomore standing, a student must complete a minimum of 24 hours with a grade point\naverage of 1.8 and have completed two regular semesters.\n\nTo qualify for junior standing, a student must complete a minimum of 54 hours with a grade point average of 1.9,\nmust complete MUTH 2200 and MUTH 2220, and must have completed four regular semesters.\n\nTo qualify for senior standing, a student must complete a minimum of 86 hours with a grade point average of 2.0\nand have completed six regular semesters.\n\nEngineering: School of Engineering students are promoted on the basis of cumulative GPA, hours earned, and\nregular semesters in residence. For the purposes of promotion, a regular semester is defined as any fall or spring\n\nPage 83 of 1019\n\n\fterm in which a student is enrolled at Vanderbilt University.

A freshman who fails to achieve sophomore standing at\nthe end of two regular semesters is placed on probation and has one additional semester in which to qualify for\nsophomore standing. This additional semester must be the summer session at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who\nfail to qualify for sophomore standing in the third semester are dropped from the university.\n\nA student qualifies for junior standing by earning 54 hours with a grade point average of at least 1.900 and having\ncompleted four regular semesters. Students who fail to qualify for junior standing at the end of two semesters after\nqualifying for sophomore standing are placed on probation and must qualify in an additional semester. This third\nsemester must be the summer session at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who do not qualify for junior standing in\nthis additional semester will be dropped from the university.\n\nA student qualifies for senior standing by earning 84 hours with a grade point average of at least 2.000 and having\ncompleted six regular semesters. A student who fails to qualify for senior standing within two semesters of\nqualifying for junior standing will be placed on probation and must qualify in one additional semester. This additional\nsemester must be the summer session at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who do not qualify for senior standing in\nthis additional semester will be dropped from the university.\nSenior in Absentia (A&S)\nArts & Science: A student who wishes to earn a baccalaureate degree in the College of Arts and Science in\nabsentia must have (a) completed the AXLE requirements and all major requirements; (b) earned at least 105 credit\nhours and a grade point average of 2.000 with at least 60 credit hours earned in a minimum of four semesters of\nresidence in the College of Arts and Science; (c) been accepted at a professional or graduate school where, during\nthe first year, the remaining credit hours needed for graduation can be earned; and (d) obtained the approval of the\nmajor department and an associate dean of the College of Arts and Science. Students who have completed fewer\nthan 105 credit hours may petition the Administrative Committee for special consideration.\n\nThe limitation on credit hours outside the College of Arts and Science applies to all bachelor of arts candidates.\n\nStudents in the senior-in-absentia program pay a minimum semester tuition charge to the College of Arts and\nScience (see Financial Information).\n\nExaminations\nExaminations (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nArts & Science: Each department establishes procedures for evaluating student performance, and normally the\nmethod of evaluation is the responsibility of the course instructor. At the beginning of the semester instructors\nshould clearly state the evaluation procedures, including types of examinations, to be used in their courses.\nStudents should have adequate opportunity during the semester to demonstrate their knowledge of the subject\nmatter and should be given an indication of their progress in the course prior to the deadline for dropping courses.\n\nPage 84 of 1019\n\n\fInstructors are cautioned against placing excessive weight on the final examination when determining a student’s\ngrade in a course.\n\nBlair: All examinations are conducted under the honor system. Primary and alternate exam schedules, which allow\ntwo hours for a final exam in each course, are listed on the University Registrar's website . The instructor may use\nthe alternate schedule in addition to, but not instead of, the primary schedule.\n\nAlternatives to standard in-class final examinations, such as term papers or take-home, self-scheduled, or oral\nexaminations may be given at the instructor’s discretion. A take-home exam is distributed at the last regular class\nmeeting and must be completed by the latest time scheduled for the final examination.\n\nPerformance examinations are scheduled by area coordinators. Students giving full recitals during the semester\nmay be exempted from performance examinations at the discretion of the instructor. If performance examinations\nare scheduled on a reading day (the day after classes end, when no course examinations are scheduled), students\nare also given the choice of a different day for their performance examinations.\n\nA student who misses a final examination may be eligible to receive the grade M (see Temporary Grades).\n\nEngineering: Examinations are usually given at the end of each semester. Exams will be no longer than three\nhours in length and are given according to the schedule published in the Final Examination Schedule. The School of\nEngineering does not offer an alternate examination schedule. All examinations are conducted under the honor\nsystem. Students must be present for all their scheduled final exams or otherwise will default on their exams.\nDead Week (A&S, Blair, PBDY)\nArts & Science: No examinations of any type—including quizzes, hour examinations, and portions of final\nexaminations—are allowed during the last week of classes; papers and in-class presentations are permitted during\ndead week. The Administrative Committee may grant special permission to the instructor in charge of a course to\ngive laboratory examinations during the last regular laboratory period of the last week of classes. The last week of\nclasses is defined as the last seven calendar days preceding the end of classes. If, for example, classes end on\nTuesday, then the “dead week” begins the preceding Wednesday and lasts through Tuesday. Students should notify\nthe Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education of any violation.\n\nBlair: The last week of classes, i.e., the last seven calendar days before the final examination period each semester,\nis designated as dead week. No examinations of any type, including quizzes, portions of final examinations, recitals,\nor ensemble performances, may be given during this time without the express written permission of the dean and\nnotification of students at least two weeks before dead week. Violations should be reported to the dean.\n\nPeabody: Because Peabody classes integrate theory and practice, many courses include significant semester-long\ngroup and individual projects that culminate in papers, presentations, simulations, or other activities at the end of\nthe semester. Therefore, while instructors are discouraged from scheduling quizzes, tests, or short-term\nassignments for the last week of the semester, Peabody’s “dead week” policy does not prohibit assignments during\nthe week before finals.\nFinal Examinations (A&S)\nArts & Science: The primary and alternate final examination schedules issued each semester allow two hours for a\nfinal examination in each course. Each in-class final examination must be given at the time indicated on the primary\nschedule. The alternate schedule is used only if the instructor decides to give an in-class examination at two times.\nThe final examination period lasts for about a week and a half.\n\nPage 85 of 1019\n\n\fAlternatives to the standard in-class final examination are permitted at the instructor’s discretion. Some examples\nare take-home examinations, oral examinations, and term papers; there need not be a final examination if\nadequate evaluation procedures have been used during the term. A take-home or oral examination should make\napproximately the same demand on a student’s time as an in-class examination and should be conducted during\nthe final examination period. A take-home examination must be distributed at the last regular class meeting and\nmust be completed by either the primary or the alternate examination date, whichever is later.\n\nAll examinations are conducted under the Honor System.\n\nThe instructor’s record of grades given during a course and any final examination papers not returned to students\nmust be kept on file by the instructor for the first month of the semester following the conclusion of the course. For\nspring semester and summer session courses, this rule means the first month of the fall semester.\n\nMonitoring these regulations is the responsibility of the departments, under the supervision of the Dean’s Office of\nUndergraduate Education. Variations from the regulations—such as changing the time of an in-class final\nexamination for an entire class—are allowed only on approval of the Administrative Committee.\nComprehensive Examinations (A&S)\nArts & Science: Any department or interdisciplinary program may require a comprehensive examination of its\nmajor students as a condition of graduation.\nSenior Re-Examination (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be\nallowed one re- examination, provided the course failed prevents the student’s graduation, and provided the student\ncould pass the course by passing a re-examination. Certain courses may be excluded from re-examination. The reexamination must be requested through the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education, and if approved, it is given\nimmediately after the close of the last semester of the student’s senior year. A student who passes the reexamination will receive a D– in the course. The terms and administration of senior re-examination are the\nresponsibility of the school that offers the course.\n\nBlair: A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be allowed one reexamination, provided the course failed would prevent the student’s graduation, and provided the student could\npass the course by passing a re-examination. Certain courses may be excluded from re-examination. The reexamination must be requested through the student’s associate dean’s office, and, if approved, it is given\nimmediately after the close of the last semester of the student’s senior year. A student who passes the reexamination will receive a D- in the course. The terms and administration of senior re-examination are the\nresponsibility of the school that offers the course. Note: For engineering students taking engineering courses, the\nsenior re-examination policy applies if a student fails not more than one course in the senior year.\n\nEngineering: A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be allowed\none re-examination, provided the course failed prevents the student’s graduation, and provided the student could\npass the course by passing a re-examination. Certain courses may be excluded from re-examination. The reexamination must be requested through the student’s Dean’s Office, and, if approved, it is given immediately after\nthe close of the last semester of the student’s senior year. A student who passes the re-examination will receive\na D- in the course. The terms and administration of senior re-examination are the responsibility of the school that\noffers the course. For engineering students, this senior re-examination policy applies if a student fails a course in\nthe final semester or fails a course in the penultimate semester that is not offered in the final semester, provided\nthat failure in that one course is the only thing preventing the student’s graduation.\n\nPeabody: A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be allowed one\nre-examination, provided the course failed prevents the student’s graduation, and provided the student could pass\nthe course by passing a re-examination. Certain courses may be excluded from re-examination.\n\nPage 86 of 1019\n\n\fThe re-examination must be requested through the Office of the Associate Deans, and if approved, it is given\nimmediately after the close of the last semester of the student’s senior year.

The terms and administration of senior re-examination are the\nresponsibility of the school that offers the course.\n\nAcademic Standards & Discipline\nAcademic Standing (VUSE)\nEngineering:\n\nGood Standing\n\nTo remain in good academic standing, a student must pursue a program leading toward a degree in the School of\nEngineering and meet all GPA and hours earned requirements at the conclusion of each fall and spring semester. A\nfirst-year student must successfully complete at least 12 hours and earn at least a 1.8 semester GPA each semester\nto remain in good standing. A sophomore, junior, or senior must complete at least 12 hours and earn at least a 2.0\nsemester GPA each semester to remain in good standing. In addition, a student must also promote to the next\nacademic class every two regular semesters according to the VUSE promotion standards (above) to remain in good\nstanding.\n\nProbation\n\nStudents who fail to meet the GPA, hours earned, or class standing promotion standards required to remain in good\nstanding will be placed on academic probation. Students who are not progressing toward a degree in the School of\nEngineering may be placed on academic probation. Students who fail to return to good standing after a semester on\nprobation will be continued on probation or dismissed. Students who are on probation for three semesters risk\ndismissal.\n\nA student authorized by the Administrative Committee to carry fewer than 12 hours because of illness or for some\nother approved reason may be placed on probation if the student’s work is deemed unsatisfactory.\n\nRequired Leave of Absence\n\nUnder certain circumstances, a student may be required to take a semester-long leave of absence from the\nuniversity. Such a leave may be required for students for whom one or more of the following conditions apply:\nFailing to pass 6 or more credit hours in a semester;\nEarning a semester grade point average of 1.4 or less; or\nFailing to improve academic achievement while on probation.\n\nDismissal\n\nAny student who is deemed by the Administrative Committee not to be making satisfactory progress toward a\ndegree in engineering will be dismissed from the School of Engineering and from Vanderbilt University. Satisfactory\nprogress includes completing required courses in a timely manner and maintaining a 2.000 GPA in all courses, in the\nschool, and in the student’s major. Causes of dismissal include:\nFailure of all courses in any semester\n\nPage 87 of 1019\n\n\fThree or more semesters on probation\nFailure to promote to the next class standing after three semesters\nFailure to progress toward a degree in the School of Engineering\nDismissed students are eligible to apply for reinstatement to the School of Engineering and to Vanderbilt University\nafter one calendar year. The reinstatement process is outlined at registrar.vanderbilt.edu/reinstatement. Students\nwho are dismissed and later apply for reinstatement are ineligible to receive transfer credit for courses taken while\ndismissed.\nSudden Academic Insufficiency (Blair, PBDY)\nBlair: Any student who fails by a wide margin to reach prescribed levels of academic achievement, either at the end\nof a semester or at mid-semester, is reviewed by the associate dean’s office in conjunction with the academic and\nstudio adviser(s). If the student is not making satisfactory progress towards the degree, the student may be placed\non probation or may be advised or required to take a leave of absence or advised to withdraw from the university.\n\nAppeals of such findings should be addressed to the Blair Curriculum Committee.\n\nPeabody: Any student who fails by a wide margin to reach prescribed levels of academic achievement, either at\nthe end of a semester or at mid-semester, or who has been placed on probation more than once is reviewed by the\nPeabody Undergraduate Administrative Committee. The Committee considers each case within the general\nguidelines for maintenance of satisfactory academic standing and may take any of several actions, among which are\nthe following:\nThe student may be placed on probation;\nThe student may be advised to take a leave of absence or to withdraw from the university;\nThe student may be required to take an academic probationary leave of absence;\nThe student may be dismissed from the university.\nUnder certain circumstances, a student who has been formally dismissed may be readmitted to Peabody. The\nPeabody Undergraduate Administrative Committee must review and approve any request for readmission.\nAcademic Discipline (A&S)\nArts & Sciences: The College of Arts and Science requires each student to maintain an academic record that will\npermit graduation according to a specified schedule. Students are considered to fall short of the expected rate of\nprogress when\n1. They pass fewer than 12 credit hours in a semester or have a semester grade point average lower than\n1.500; or\n2. In a summer they take 12 or more credit hours but pass fewer than 12 credit hours or earn a grade point\naverage lower than 1.500; or\n3. They fail to achieve sophomore, junior, or senior standing within the time allowed; or\n4. They accumulate more than two probations after the freshman year, in which case they will normally be\ndropped from the university; or\n5. As first-semester freshmen they pass fewer than two courses or earn a semester grade point average lower\nthan 1.000, in which case they may be required to take a probationary leave of absence; or\n6. As first-semester freshmen they earn fewer than 9 credit hours or a semester grade point average lower than\n1.500, in which case they may be offered a choice (see Semester Requirements below).\nAny student who falls somewhat short of the prescribed levels of academic achievement is normally placed on\nprobation. Any student who fails by a wide margin to reach these levels or who has been placed on probation more\nthan once is reviewed by the Administrative Committee, and may be dropped from the university without having\npreviously been placed on academic probation. The committee considers each case within the framework of the\nguidelines outlined below and may take any of several actions, among which are the following:\n1. The student may be placed on probation;\n2. The student may be advised to take a leave of absence or to withdraw from the university;\n3. The student may be required to take a leave of absence;\n4. The student may be dropped from the university.\nSemester Requirements (A&S)\n\nPage 88 of 1019\n\n\fArts & Science: Full-time students are expected to earn each semester at least 12 credit hours and a minimum\ngrade point average of 1.500. Students who fall short of these levels are normally placed on probation. Students are\nremoved from probation after earning at least 12 credit hours and a semester grade point average of 1.500 or\nbetter, assuming they have fulfilled the requirements for class standing stated below.\n\nFirst-year students who pass fewer than two regular courses in their first regular semester or who earn a semester\ngrade point average lower than 1.000 have so seriously compromised their academic standing that they may be\nrequired to take a probationary leave of absence until the beginning of the following fall semester.\n\nFirst-year students who earn fewer than 9 credit hours or a grade point average lower than 1.500 in the fall may, at\nthe discretion of the Administrative Committee, choose a probationary leave for the spring and return the next fall\nwith two semesters in which to qualify for sophomore standing.\n\nA student on probationary leave may not earn credit at another institution for transfer to Vanderbilt. In appropriate\ncases the Administrative Committee may prescribe conditions that must be satisfied before the student returns from\na probationary leave. Students who do not choose to return at the end of a probationary leave but want to return\nlater are required to apply for reinstatement.\n\nAfter their first year, full-time students may not be placed on probation more than twice (continuance on probation\nfor a second semester counts as another probation). If a student’s performance is deficient a third time, the student\nis dropped from the university.\n\nStudents who have been authorized to carry fewer than 12 credit hours because of illness or outside employment\nmay be placed on academic probation if their work is deemed unsatisfactory by the Administrative Committee; they\nare removed from probation when the committee deems their work satisfactory. If they are not removed from\nprobation after a reasonable period of time, such students are dropped.\n\nThe internal record of a student dropped from the university under these regulations shows the notation “Dropped\nfor scholastic deficiency.”\nAcademic Probation and Dismissal (Blair, PBDY)\nBlair: Students are placed on probation if they fail to meet class standing benchmarks, as noted above. Students on\nprobation must qualify for class standing in one additional semester or risk being dropped from the university.\n\nStudents are placed on academic probation: if they fail to meet class standing benchmarks; if they complete fewer\nthan 12 hours in a fall or spring semester except in cases involving documented mitigating circumstances (illness,\ninjury, or family emergency); or if their semester grade point averages fall below 1.8 overall or 2.0 in music. In\naddition, first-year students are placed on academic probation if they do not complete one writing course.\n\nIncomplete grades may adversely affect class standing or grade point averages.\n\nStudents on academic probation may not transfer summer study credit, elect to take courses on a Pass/Fail basis,\nearn credit by departmental examination, or participate in any extracurricular performance activity. They are\nrequired to participate in a special academic advising program. Students will be placed on probation no more than\ntwice. Students who are candidates for probation a third time will be dropped from the university.\n\nPeabody: After achieving sophomore standing, the student may not be on academic probation for more than two\n\nPage 89 of 1019\n\n\fsemesters. A student whose academic record warrants a third semester of probation normally will be dropped from\nthe university. Students will be placed on academic probation if any of the following conditions apply:\n\nFreshmen\n1. The student’s cumulative grade point average falls below 1.800. Probation is removed (assuming there is no\nother reason for the probation) when the student’s grade point average is raised to 1.800 or above.\n2. The student fails to earn at least 12 hours in a regular semester as a freshman. Probation is removed when\nthe student earns at least 12 hours in a subsequent semester and/or is judged to be making satisfactory\nacademic progress.\n3. The student fails to achieve sophomore standing in the required two semesters. Probation is removed when\nthe student achieves sophomore standing.\n4. Freshmen who pass fewer than two regular courses in their first regular semester or who earn a grade point\naverage lower than 1.000 have so seriously compromised their academic standing that they may be required\nto take an academic probationary leave of absence during the spring semester.\n\nSophomores\n1. The student’s cumulative grade point average falls below 1.800. Probation is removed (assuming there is no\nother reason for the probation) when the student’s grade point average is raised to 1.800 or above, except\nthat at the end of the second regular semester the student must qualify for junior standing.\n2. The student fails to earn at least 12 hours in a regular semester as a sophomore. Probation is removed when\nthe student earns at least 12 hours in a subsequent semester and/or is judged to be making satisfactory\nacademic progress.\n3. The student is placed on probation by the Undergraduate Administrative Committee for failure to make\nsatisfactory progress toward the degree. Probation is removed when the specified conditions are met.\n4. The student fails to achieve junior standing in the required two semesters after achieving sophomore\nstanding. Probation is removed when junior standing is achieved.\n\nJuniors\n1. The student’s cumulative grade point average falls below 1.900. Probation is removed (assuming there is no\nother reason for the probation) when the grade point average is raised to 900 or above, except that at the\nend of the second regular semester the student must qualify for senior standing.\n2. The student fails to earn at least 12 hours in a regular semester as a junior. Probation is removed when the\nstudent earns at least 12 hours in a subsequent semester and/or is judged to be making satisfactory\nacademic progress.\n3. The student is placed on probation by the Undergraduate Administrative Committee for failure to make\nsatisfactory progress toward the degree. Probation is removed when the specified conditions are met.\n4. The student fails to achieve senior standing in the required two semesters after achieving junior standing.\nProbation is removed when senior standing is achieved.\n\nSeniors\n1. The student’s cumulative grade point average falls below 2.000. Probation is removed when the grade point\naverage is raised to 2.000 or above.\n2. The student fails to earn at least 12 hours in a regular semester as a senior, unless the semester is one in\nwhich the student needs fewer than 12 hours in order to complete the requirements for graduation (see\nsection on Course Load, above). Probation is removed when the student earns at least 12 hours in a\nsubsequent semester and/or is judged to be making satisfactory academic progress and/or completes the\nrequirements for graduation.\nPetitions and Appeals (A&S, PBDY)\nArts & Science: The Administrative Committee of the College of Arts and Science entertains petitions from\ncurrently enrolled students for exceptions to academic regulations. Any student subject to action by the\nAdministrative Committee may appeal that action to the committee in writing. Further appeals from decisions of the\ncommittee follow standard university policies as described in the Student Handbook.\n\nPeabody: The procedures of the appeal process pertaining to academic matters within Peabody College are listed\nbelow. Please see the chapter “Student Accountability” in the Vanderbilt University Student Handbook for a\ndescription of the appeal process for non-academic matters.\n\nPage 90 of 1019\n\n\fPetitions for exceptions to academic policies, appeals of academic policy implementations by Peabody Dean’s Office\nstaff, and appeals of academic actions by the Undergraduate Administrative Committee (UAC) Chair (e.g., letters of\ndismissal) may be directed to the full UAC.\n\nPetitions and appeals should be sent to the Peabody Office of Academic Services\n- peabodyacademicservices@vanderbilt.edu, Peabody Administration Building.\n\nA student may ask the UAC to reconsider a decision if the student has new information to offer. The chair of the UAC\nwill decide whether the full UAC will reconsider. Requests for reconsideration of UAC decisions should be sent to the\nabove address.\n\nA final, negative decision of the UAC may be appealed to the dean of Peabody College (at the above address), who\nmay assign an associate dean to handle the matter on the dean’s behalf. The dean or associate dean will consult\nwith the UAC and other relevant faculty or staff as part of the review of the decision.\n\nFurther appeals beyond Peabody College should be directed to the Provost’s Office.\n\nEnrollment Status & Changes\nTransfer Students (Blair)\nAlternate Track (PBDY)\nLeave of Absence (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nReturning to the College (A&S)\nWithdrawal from the University (A&S, VUSE, PBDY)\nChange of Address (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\n\nTransfer Students (Blair)\nBlair: Transfer applicants must comply with university standards (see the chapter on Admissions). The required\naudition is of major importance in the evaluation of any application. Composition applicants must submit a\ncomposition portfolio and interview with a member of the composition faculty.\n\nTransfer students must submit catalog copy and course syllabi from the previous institution(s). A level of\nperformance study is assigned based on the entrance audition. Credit for courses is subject to evaluation. Music\ncourses may require an examination to verify placement and/or credit at Vanderbilt, and credit for non-music\ncourses must be approved through the YES Transfer Credit portal. Transfer students must complete at least half the\ncredit required for the degree, or 63 hours, at the Blair School. See also, Transfer courses.\n\nIntra-university transfer. Students intending to transfer within the university should meet with the head of academic\nadvising and file appropriate paperwork. For students transferring out of the B.Mus. or B.Mus.Arts program, music\nfees are covered through the end of the final term as a B.Mus. or B.Mus.Arts student. All students are expected to\nmaintain a minimum of 3 credit hours within their home school until transfer is approved. First-year students are\nineligible for transfer status until the end of their second semester. Students who transferred to Vanderbilt\nUniversity from another institution are eligible for intra-university transfer after having completed one semester in\nresidence and having achieved sophomore standing. See also, the chapter on Admissions.\n\nPage 91 of 1019\n\n\fAlternate Track (PBDY)\nPeabody: Occasionally students find that it will be necessary to reduce their normal load due to medical reasons,\nvarsity athletics, or other circumstances. The result is that they will accomplish the bachelor of science degree in\nnine or ten semesters instead of eight. In such cases, the student may request Alternate Track status. After\ndiscussing this option with their parents and faculty adviser, students petition the Associate Dean for Undergraduate\nAcademic Affairs for permission. This normally takes place during the sophomore year. Additional information is\navailable by contacting the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic Affairs.\nLeave of Absence (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: A student desiring a leave of absence should obtain instructions from the Dean’s Office of\nUndergraduate Education in the College of Arts and Science. All students who have completed one regular\n(fall/spring) semester at Vanderbilt are eligible, provided they have not been dropped by the university and are not\ndropped at the end of the semester during which application is made. Students may take a leave no more than twice\nduring their career in the College of Arts and Science.\n\nLeaves are granted for one semester or for a year. Applications should be completed before the end of the fall\nsemester for a leave of absence during the spring semester, and before August 15 for a leave of absence during the\nfall semester (or for the academic year). If the leave is approved, the student must keep the Office of the University\nRegistrar informed of any change of address while on leave.\n\nA student who takes a medical leave after mid-semester is expected to be on leave for the following regular\nsemester as well. A student who plans to return from medical leave must submit appropriate documentation to the\nDean’s Office of Undergraduate Education and the Office of Student Care Coordination.\n\nA student in good standing who seeks to transfer to Vanderbilt credit earned elsewhere while on leave of absence\nmust obtain permission in advance from the Office of Undergraduate Education. Requests for leave of absence for\npurpose of semester study away may be allowed if the semester study-away institution is domestic to the student.\nRequests for leave of absence plus semester study away are not allowed if the semester study-away institution is\ninternational to the student.\n\nRegistration information is emailed to students on leave of absence. A student failing to register at the conclusion of\nthe stated leave will be withdrawn from the university and must apply for reinstatement.\n\nBlair: A student in good standing may, with the approval of the associate dean, take leave of absence for one or two\nsemesters. Application forms, available from the Blair Office of Academic Services, must be submitted by 1\nDecember for spring semester leave or by 1 May for fall semester.\n\nStudents planning to study elsewhere while on leave (elective courses) must have prior approval if credits are to be\ntransferable. Upon the student’s return, a performance examination during the first two weeks of the semester may\nbe needed to determine the student’s standing in the major performance area.\n\nRegistration notifications are emailed to students on leave. A student failing to register at the conclusion of the\nstated leave will be withdrawn from the university and must apply for readmission.\n\nStudents who have been on leave of absence and not enrolled for three or more semesters or who leave the\nuniversity while on academic probation must re-audition and achieve the approval of the associate dean prior to\nreadmission.\n\nPage 92 of 1019\n\n\fEngineering: A student at Vanderbilt or one who has been admitted to Vanderbilt may, with the approval of his or\nher academic dean, take an official leave of absence for as much as two semesters and a summer session. Leave of\nabsence forms are available in the Office of Academic Services. A student who fails to register in the university at\nthe end of the leave will be withdrawn from the university.\n\nPeabody: A student desiring a leave of absence should obtain the appropriate forms from the Peabody Office of\nAcademic Services website: peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-offices/oas/downloads.php. All students are eligible,\nprovided they have not been dropped by the university and are not dropped at the end of the semester during which\napplication is made.\n\nLeaves are granted for one or two semesters. Applications should be completed before the end of the fall semester\nfor a leave of absence during the spring semester and before 15 August for a leave of absence during the fall\nsemester (or for the academic year). If the leave is approved, the student must keep the Dean’s Office informed of\nany change of address while on leave.\n\nShould a student seek to transfer to Vanderbilt credit earned elsewhere while on a leave of absence, it is mandatory\nthat permission be obtained in advance from the Dean’s Office. Petitions for leaves of this type must be filed at\nleast one month before the close of the preceding semester.\n\nWhile the student is on leave, registration information will be emailed to his or her Vanderbilt email address. A\nstudent failing to register at the conclusion of the stated leave will be withdrawn from the university and must apply\nfor readmission.\n\nStudents who wish to participate in a non-Vanderbilt program in the United States, abroad, or at sea should apply\nfor a leave of absence for the relevant semester. To qualify for such a leave, a student must be in good standing at\nVanderbilt with at least a 2.700 grade point average as of the date of application. Students must obtain prior\napproval for the leave of absence and for the credits to be taken in other programs if the credits are to be\ntransferred to Vanderbilt. Final approval of leaves of absence always rests with the Dean’s Office. See the section on\nTransfer Credit in this chapter.\nReturning to the College (A&S)\nArts & Science: Students on leave of absence return to the university at the end of the leave. If they do not return\nat that time and want to return later, they must apply to the Office of the University Registrar for reinstatement.\nStudents who are advised to withdraw from the university determine whether or not to return in consultation with\nthe Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education. Students who have been dropped may apply to the Office of the\nUniversity Registrar for reinstatement; in most cases reinstatement is not granted unless there has been an\nintervening period of at least a year. The Office of the University Registrar forwards all documents to the\nAdministrative Committee, which considers each case on an individual basis. Reinstatement is competitive, and\nthere is no assurance that it will be granted.\n\nStudents reinstated after having been advised to withdraw or after having been dropped are automatically on final\nprobation. If they fail to regain good standing and to maintain it until graduation, they are dropped again with little\nprospect for reinstatement. Application deadlines for reinstatement are as follows: July 15 for the fall semester,\nNovember 15 for the spring semester, and April 1 for the summer session.\nWithdrawal from the University (A&S, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Sciences: Students proposing to withdraw from the university during a regular term must report to the\nDean’s Office of Undergraduate Education in the College of Arts and Science to initiate proper clearance procedures.\nIf withdrawal from the university is officially authorized, the student will receive withdrawal grades on the same\nbasis as a student withdrawing from a particular course or courses. (See the section on Period for Withdrawal under\nRegistration above).\n\nPage 93 of 1019\n\n\fEngineering: A student proposing to withdraw from the university must notify the Office of Academic Services of\nthe School of Engineering so that proper clearance may be granted and incomplete work is not charged as a failure\nagainst the student’s record.\n\nPeabody: Students proposing to withdraw from the university during any semester must report to the Associate\nDean for Undergraduate Academic Affairs to initiate proper clearance procedures. Students are graded on the same\nbasis as if withdrawing from a course. Students who withdraw before the end of the eighth week of classes receive a\npartial refund of tuition (see the section on Financial Information).\nChange of Address (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nArts & Science: Students are responsible for keeping the university informed of their correct mailing addresses,\nboth school and home. They should notify the university, through the Office of the University Registrar, online or in\nwriting, of any address changes as soon as possible. They are provided an opportunity to review address information\nat registration. The university will consider notices and other information delivered if mailed to the address on file in\nthe Office of the University Registrar.\n\nBlair: Any change of address should be submitted to the Office of the University Registrar at yes.vanderbilt.edu.\nThe university will consider notices or other information delivered if mailed to the address currently on file.\n\nEngineering: Any change of address should be reported to the Office of the University Registrar using the YES\nonline form. The university will consider notices or other information delivered if mailed to the address on file in YES.\n\nSpecial Programs\nImmersion Vanderbilt (Blair, VUSE)\nBlair: To fulfill the university requirement of Immersion Vanderbilt, a student must participate in an intensive\nlearning experience that takes place in and beyond the classroom and culminates in the creation of a tangible final\nproject. This requirement applies to all students who entered Vanderbilt as first-year students in or after summer\n2018, as second-year students in or after summer 2019, or as third-year students in or after summer 2020.\n\nImmersion Vanderbilt is divided into four broad pathways: civic and professional, creative expression, international,\nand research. The pathway selected by the student may focus on one or more than one of these areas and should\nprovide a structure upon which students can brainstorm, plan, and execute their immersive projects across multiple\nyears.\n\nMost Blair students will take advantage of the senior recital experience or honors thesis in\nethnomusicology/musicology to satisfy the requirements of Immersion Vanderbilt. However, students may choose to\npursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. Students should consult the Office of Experiential Learning\nand Immersion Vanderbilt. Completion of the Immersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement will be shown on the\nstudent's degree audit, and the title of the Immersion project will be added to the student's\ntranscript. vanderbilt.edu/immersion\n\nEngineering: Immersion Vanderbilt (vanderbilt.edu/immersion) allows students to pursue a multi-year path to be\ncurious, to develop their passions and to learn by experience. To fulfill the university requirement of Immersion\nVanderbilt, a student must participate in immersive experiences and then complete a culminating project that is\nbased on one specific immersive experience.\n\nThe experiential learning may focus on one or more areas of student interest. Most engineering students will take\n\nPage 94 of 1019\n\n\fadvantage of a four-year engineering design experience to satisfy the requirements of Immersion Vanderbilt. Each\nengineering major offers such a multi-year experience within its curriculum. Students whose plans include\nprofessional development may also pursue industrial internships. A research path can engage the student in\ndiscovery through research in engineering or other fields. While most engineering students will select an immersion\nexperience associated with their major, students can pursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. For\nexample, students interested in creative expression might develop a performance piece, exhibit, or artistic work,\nwhile those interested in international study may explore firsthand the culture, language, and history of other\ncountries. Students interested in such immersion plans should consult the Office of Experiential Learning and\nImmersion Vanderbilt.\n\nThe Immersion Vanderbilt process is composed of several phases. The initial step involves the creation of a plan that\nidentifies the intended Immersive experience. Before students start their immersive experience, they will submit the\nImmersive Experience Declaration Form. Students may submit multiple immersive experience forms throughout\ntheir time at Vanderbilt University. After each experience, a self-reflection component is required.\n\nImmersion Vanderbilt culminates in the creation of a final project arising from one of the experiences. Approval and\nassessment of the project is done by the supervising school or college. Senior design projects in the School of\nEngineering satisfy the final project requirement for Immersion Vanderbilt, with students presenting the results of\ntheir design project at the school’s Design Day. For students completing other immersion projects, Immersion\ncoordinates a series of showcases open to the entire campus where students display their projects. Upon completion\nof the project, Immersion Vanderbilt conveys that the requirements have been met by showing completion of the\nImmersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement on the student’s degree audit and adding the Immersion project to\nthe student’s transcript.\nStudy Abroad (Blair)\nBlair: Five Vanderbilt study abroad programs are coordinated with the degree programs in music: the IES programs\nin Milan, Italy; Vienna, Austria; and in Amsterdam, The Netherlands; the DIS program at the Royal Danish Academy\nof Music in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the IFSA/Butler program at the University of Sydney and Sydney\nConservatorium of Music in Sydney, Australia. These programs include provisions for lesson and ensemble credits,\ncontingent upon audition and admission to the program. These will count towards the Blair music core and are\ncovered at least in part by regular tuition and fees, although students are responsible for any instrument rental fees\nthey accrue. All programs also allow for a range of liberal arts and elective credits. Further information can be\nobtained from the Vanderbilt Global Education Office, Suite 103, Student Life Center, or vanderbilt.edu/geo, and\nfrom Blair’s associate dean.\n\nBlair students may also elect any of the Vanderbilt-approved study abroad programs; see descriptions under “Study\nAbroad” in the front chapters of the catalog. Blair students in these programs have typically enrolled in music\nelectives, courses in the liberal arts core, and course work toward minors and second majors. Students in these\nprograms typically arrange alternative performance or composition instruction, and those fees are usually not\ncovered by tuition. It should be noted that if a program has been approved by Vanderbilt students must enroll in the\nprogram via the Global Education Office. In no case, after matriculating at Vanderbilt, may a student apply to\nparticipate in a program for transfer credit through a different university, or through an external agency, and then\nseek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt. Any student studying abroad must register with Vanderbilt's global travel\noffice.\n\nBlair-Specific Provisions\nInternships (Blair)\nBlair: The Career Center assists students interested in internship opportunities in the music industry and elsewhere;\nthere are opportunities in many states of the U.S. and also abroad, both during the academic year and in the\nsummer. A student serving as an intern may register for MENT 3880, 3881, or 3882 as a corollary if credit is desired.\nStudents with summer internships that require an academic component must register for credit\n(vanderbilt.edu/career/career-exploration/internships/summer-internship-subsidy/). A maximum of 6 hours of\ninternship credit may be counted toward the degree. Students are responsible for finding a faculty sponsor; a\nwritten study plan must be approved by the faculty sponsor and the Blair associate dean no later than the tenth day\nof classes. Internship paperwork is available on the Blair School website at blair.vanderbilt.edu/academics.\n\nPage 95 of 1019\n\n\fPerformance Instruction: B. Mus. and B. Mus. Arts Degrees (Blair)\nBlair: Fees. Performance instruction fees are waived for B.Mus. and B.Mus.Arts students. A one-time music\ntechnology fee is charged to each first-year student.\n\nElective credit. B.Mus. and B.Mus.Arts students taking a second instrument normally enroll in 1100-level\nperformance instruction for 1 or 2 hours elective credit. Consent of the instructor is required. B.Mus. and B.Mus.Arts\nstudents who have declared a minor instrument also register for performance instruction at the 1100 level; consent\nof the instructor and notification of the Blair Office of Academic Services are required.\n\nComposition Majors . Students register for performance instruction at the 1100 level. A minimum of 6 semesters of\nstudy totaling 6 credit hours is required.\n\nIntegrated Studies Majors, Integrated Studies/Teacher Education Majors, Jazz Studies Majors, and B.Mus.Arts\nstudents. First-year students and sophomores register for 2100-level performance instruction in their primary area.\nJuniors and seniors register for 4100-level performance instruction in their primary area. A minimum of 8 semesters\ntotaling 16 credit hours required; performance instruction required every semester in residence.\n\nPerformance Majors. First-year students and sophomores register for 2200-level performance instruction in their\nprimary area. Juniors and seniors register for 4200-level instruction in their primary area. A minimum of 8 semesters\ntotaling 32 hours (instrumental performance majors) or 28 hours (vocal performance majors) required; performance\ninstruction required every semester in residence.\nUpper Divisional Hearing (Blair)\nBlair: Requirements for performance majors include an upper divisional hearing in the sophomore year to\ndetermine continuance in the performance degree program and permit subsequent enrollment in upper division\nstudy at the 4200 level. Students are required to perform a program of twenty to thirty minutes for a faculty\ncommittee convened by the studio instructor or by the department chair. The committee will normally consist of the\nstudent’s studio teacher and at least two additional members of the department. Memorization is required as\nappropriate, and where called for, collaboration with piano is expected.\n\nThe student must consult with the studio instructor regarding appropriate repertoire. Instrumental selections must\nbe chosen from the solo repertoire and should represent diverse historical periods. Percussionists must perform on\nkeyboard percussion, timpani, and snare drum and/or multiple percussion. String repertoire must include solo Bach.\nPianists must perform a 30-minute memorized program of solo piano literature representing at least three style\nperiods. Vocal repertoire must include a minimum of five songs of contrasting periods and styles, using three\nlanguages (Italian, English, and either French or German).\n\nFailure to pass this hearing demonstrates a lack of the requisite skills to graduate in performance at the Blair School,\nnecessitating transfer to another degree program. A student may petition the faculty once for a second hearing,\nwith entirely different repertoire, to take place before the end of the first semester of the junior year\nPre-Recital Hearing (Blair)\nBlair: All students (excepting composition) giving required recitals and any student who wishes to give a recital in\nthe Blair building must pass a hearing, held at least three weeks before the recital. After establishing a recital date,\nthe student, with guidance from the studio instructor, will assemble a recital hearing committee, consisting of two\nadditional faculty members, one of whom must be from outside the student’s performing area. For integrated\nstudies/teacher education students, the committee will normally consist of the studio instructor, a teacher education\nfaculty member, and at least one additional faculty member. For non-required, non-credit recitals, the hearing\ncommittee may be from within the department. For any recital involving a student’s second performing medium, the\nstudent must seek approval from the studio instructor and area coordinator of the secondary and primary\nperforming areas; in addition, a full-time faculty member from the secondary performing area must be part of the\n\nPage 96 of 1019\n\n\fhearing committee. The student must notify the recital hearing committee, in writing, of the hearing date, recital\ndate, time, and place. Senior composition recitals are screened in advance at the department level.\n\nFor a required junior or senior recital, the repertoire will normally encompass three major style periods, as\nappropriate to the medium; at least one work in a contemporary idiom will be included in either the junior or senior\nrecital. For teacher education students, a conducting component must be included on the required senior recital. For\njazz studies students, an original composition or arrangement must be included on the required senior recital. A\nrequired senior recital must also include written or spoken program notes, visual media, or other audience\nengagement component, with the approval of the studio instructor. The hearing committee should hear all of the\nrecital repertoire. Grading of the hearing is on a Pass/Fail basis, with written faculty comments. If a student fails the\nhearing, another must be scheduled. Only two recital hearings in one semester are permitted.\n\nFor students also choosing the senior recital to fulfill Immersion Vanderbilt, the recital program and audience\nengagement component should be a deeper, more intensive project that integrates classroom knowledge with\nexperience. The student will work with the project’s primary Immersion adviser (usually the studio teacher) to\ndevelop a plan relevant to the student’s recital. While there are no specific requirements, examples may be found in\nthe Blair Student Handbook. The student’s Immersion adviser will ultimately decide if the plan fulfills the Immersion\nVanderbilt project.\nRecital and Recital Committee (Blair)\nBlair: For recitals given for credit, the recital committee is the same as the hearing committee whenever possible.\nThe final grade is a composite of those of at least two committee members, including the studio instructor, with the\nstudio instructor’s grade valued at two thirds of the total. Copies of committee member’s grades are kept by the\ninstructor. Recitals not given for credit are not graded; they involve a hearing committee but not a recital\ncommittee.\nRecital Attendance (Blair)\nBlair: Each semester in residence, students (except graduating seniors in their penultimate or final semester) are\nrequired to register for MUSO 1000 and attend weekly student recitals/convocations and a minimum of six Blair\nfaculty or professional concerts or their community equivalents as described on the syllabus. Students must fulfill\nboth aspects of the requirement to pass each semester. The course receives zero credit hours but is graded on a\nPass/Fail basis and listed on students’ transcripts. A temporary final grade will not be granted except in the case of\ndocumented medical emergency.\n\nStudents must register their attendance at each recital. Two absences from Friday afternoon recitals are permitted\neach semester. Under extraordinary circumstances, make-up assignments can be obtained from the recital\nattendance coordinator with the permission of the associate dean. Students must plan and keep up with their\nconcert attendance. Except for weekly student recitals, performances in which students are participants do not fulfill\nthe attendance requirement for the performer. Deadline for completion of all work is listed on the course syllabus for\nMUSO 1000. The first failure would result in the loss of the senior penultimate or final semester exemption.\nAdditional failure(s) would require students to enroll for additional semester(s) until the seven required semesters\nare passed.\nExtracurricular Performance (Blair)\nBlair: Students must be in good standing and have the consent of their private instructors in order to participate in\nany extracurricular performance activities, including in-school collaboration, that are not required by a student’s\ndegree program or honor scholarship.\n\nCollege of Arts and Science\nCollege of Arts and Science Administration and Faculty\nTimothy P.

It is the basis of all professional study. No professional\nschool can be self-sufficient. The College in its undergraduate and graduate work must remain the heart of the whole\nsituation, and send its quickening life blood into every fiber and tissue.”\n—Chancellor James H. Kirkland at the semicentennial celebration of the university October 1925\n\nChancellor Kirkland’s words were prophetic of our times as well as true of his own. Since its founding Vanderbilt has\npursued its mission of excellence in the liberal arts with a commitment to liberal learning that is the special concern\nof the College of Arts and Science. Liberal learning endures because it brings men and women to subjects, concepts,\nand modes of thought that enable them to think critically about where humanity has been and where it ought to be\ngoing. The liberal arts spark curiosity and broaden vision, help to instill understanding of matters otherwise\nunknown, and encourage individuals to live their lives with a sense of purpose, context, and relatedness. A liberal\neducation has perennial relevance and usefulness: it should prepare its recipients to think precisely, to reason\nclearly, and to judge wisely—all practical considerations in the pursuit of constructive and satisfying lives and in the\npractice of today’s professions and vocations.\n\nToday the College of Arts and Science maintains its historic position as the heart of the university. Excellence in\nundergraduate and graduate education is its unwavering aim.\n\nThe College of Arts and Science provides intellectual stimulation, training, and incentive designed to foster the\nlifelong liberal learning of its graduates. It offers challenging, forward-looking programs of study in the humanities,\nnatural sciences, and social sciences resourcefully taught by distinguished faculty recognized for excellence in\nresearch, scholarship, and creative expression. It promotes self-realization and expression in the context of social\nresponsibility.\n\nFaculty and Students\nThe College of Arts and Science derives its strength from the range of its academic offerings, from the quality of the\nfaculty who teach, and from the quality of the students who come to learn. Traditionally fortunate in its ability to\nattract and retain a superior faculty, the College of Arts and Science has more than 500 full-time professors who\nsupplement their achievements in the classroom with significant research, creativity, and writing. Many faculty\nmembers hold awards for distinguished scholarship and have been elected to high offices in their professional\nassociations, including the Classical Association of the Middle West and South, the American Economics Association,\nthe American Political Science Association, the American Philosophical Association, the American Physical Society,\n\nPage 99 of 1019\n\n\fthe American Historical Association, and the Biophysical Society.\n\nThe quality of the College’s faculty is matched by that of its diverse student body. Undergraduates come from the\nfifty states and fifteen to twenty foreign countries and are almost evenly divided between men and women.\n\nAcademic Support\nThe Writing Studio / Tutoring Services\nThe Writing Studio provides undergraduate students the opportunity to meet with trained writing consultants to\ndiscuss individual writing concerns, from invention to drafting to revision. The Writing Studio provides a space for\nstudents to discuss work-in-progress with expert writers, to create their own writing, and to utilize available\nresources for improving both writing and critical thinking skills.\n\nThe mission of the Vanderbilt Writing Studio is to enhance student writing and writing instruction, and to encourage\nregular conversation about the writing process. The Writing Studio’s extensive programming includes individual\nconsultations, creative writing groups, workshops focused on specific issues in academic writing, open- mike\nreadings, and student-run writers’ support groups.\n\nThe Writing Studio is located at 1801 Edgehill Avenue, Suite 112, and there is a satellite location in 217 Commons\nCenter convenient to the first-year residence halls. The Writing Studio website can be accessed at\n\nOne-on-one tutoring in many subjects is available through Tutoring Services, also located at 1801 Edgehill Avenue.\nConsultations in the Writing Studio and in Tutoring Services are free to all undergraduates.\n\nComputers\nThe following locations are available for walk-in use of computers and software:\n\nCenter for Second Language Studies (Furman Hall 001)\nStevenson computer lab and lounge (Stevenson Center 2200)\nWilson computer lab (Wilson Hall 120)\n\nAll of the college’s computer labs and classrooms offer a wide variety of “courseware” and commercial “productivity\nsoftware,” including word processing packages. Color printing and scanners are available in most of the labs. In\naddition to accessing software on the local servers, students may also connect to both campus services and the\ninternet, including VUGmail and e-resources in the libraries, as well as course materials in Brightspace. While use of\nthe above facilities is free, printing is charged per page.\n\nThe computer classrooms in the Center for Second Language Studies and Wilson Hall are available for walk-in use\nduring the late afternoon and evening hours. Stevenson Center lab and lounge are card-accessible weeknights until\n1:00\na.m. All lab hours are posted by semester at In addition to the college facilities, a few “kiosk” systems are available\nin the Sarratt Student Center. As a result, access to computers in the College of Arts and Science is extensive.\n\nPage 100 of 1019\n\n\fAt last count, more than 98 percent of Vanderbilt students own a personal computer. Since all students also have a\nhigh-speed network connection, it is convenient for students to have their own system (please consult the ResNet\nguidelines for supported systems). However, most students will find that the college computing facilities provide all\nof the computing resources that are needed for success at Vanderbilt.\n\nThe Advising System\nEntering first-year students are assigned advisers from CASPAR (College of Arts and Science Pre-major Academic\nAdvising Resources Center). These “pre-major advisers” counsel students during their first three and one-half\nsemesters, or until the students choose majors, when they are assigned faculty advisers in their major department\nor program. Pre-major advisers are specially trained to help students move efficiently through the requirements of\nAXLE (Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education) and chart a course of study.\n\nDuring the last two years of study, when a student is acquiring depth of knowledge in a major field, studies are\nguided by a specialist in that field. Students are encouraged to see their faculty advisers at any time, since the\nadvisers are available for guidance and counseling and are faculty members with whom advisees may be studying.\n\nAll students are required to see their advisers prior to registration for each semester.\n\nAdvisers are generally happy to talk over any problems students may have, although their chief function is\nacademic counseling. In addition, several members of the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education, themselves\nteaching faculty members, have as their principal duty counseling students and referring them to sources of\nexpertise on non-academic problems.\n\nPublic Lectures\nTHE BERRY LECTURES. Established in 1988 through the generosity of Kendall and Allen Berry, John and Shirley\nLachs, Steve Turner, and Jim Burke.

Inaugurated in 1982 and funded by one of his former students,\nthis lectureship honors the late Walter Clyde Curry, distinguished medieval and Renaissance scholar, author of\nbooks on Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton, and for forty years beloved professor of English at Vanderbilt. Bringing\nto campus in alternate years eminent Shakespearean scholars and experienced Shakespearean performers, the\n\nPage 101 of 1019\n\n\flectureship gratefully recognizes Professor Curry’s devoted service and lasting contributions to the university.\n\nTHE WAITE PHILIP FISHEL LECTURE. Established in 1974 as a tribute to Professor Fishel, who was known as an\noutstanding, popular teacher and was renowned for his research in metallurgy. Through the generosity of family,\ncolleagues, students, and friends, the lecture is presented by a leading inorganic chemist.\n\nTHE HARRY C. HOWARD JR. LECTURESHIP. Established in 1994 at the Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities\nin honor of Harry C. Howard Jr. (B.A. 1951). The lectureship was endowed by Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Nash Jr. and Mr.\nand Mrs. George Renfro, all of Asheville, North Carolina, in honor of their longtime friend and attorney. The\nlectureship allows the Warren Center to bring an outstanding scholar to Vanderbilt annually to deliver a lecture on a\nsignificant topic in the humanities.\n\nTHE ARTHUR WILLIAM INGERSOLL MEMORIAL LECTURE. Established in 1973 to honor Arthur Ingersoll, professor of\norganic chemistry at Vanderbilt until his death in 1969. Each year contributions for this lecture are received from\nfamily, colleagues, students, and friends. A leading organic chemist is invited to present the lecture.\n\nTHE CARL K. SEYFERT LECTURE IN ASTRONOMY. Established in 1983 as part of the astronomy program’s\ncommemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the Arthur J. Dyer Observatory. The lectureship recognizes the\nuntiring efforts and contributions to astronomy made by Carl K. Seyfert, professor of astronomy and first director of\nthe Dyer Observatory. A distinguished astronomer is invited to present this lecture every third year.\n\nTHE SHANKS LECTURES. Established in 1984 and named for E. Baylis Shanks and Olivia H. Shanks in honor of their\naccomplishments in the fields of mathematics and education and in recognition of their loyalty and service to\nVanderbilt University, these lectures are presented on two successive days in the fall of each year. A special\ncommittee from the Department of Mathematics, influenced by the professional interests of Professor and Mrs.\nShanks, chooses the lecturers from mathematicians of the highest reputation. The topics of the lectureship vary\nfrom year to year according to the area of specialization of the speaker chosen. The lectures have been endowed by\nmembers of the family of Olivia and Baylis Shanks.\n\nTHE FRANCIS G. SLACK LECTURES IN PHYSICS. Established in 1977 by the Department of Physics and Astronomy in\nhonor of Francis G. Slack, former Landon C. Garland professor of physics and chair of the department, these lectures\nrecognize his many contributions to physics.

Recent participants have included Dannie\nAbse, Madison Smartt Bell, Ellen Gilchrist, Alison Lurie, Czeslaw Milosz, Wyatt Prunty, Ann Thwaite, Anthony\nThwaite, and Helen Vendler.\n\nDegree Programs in the College\nThe Bachelor of Arts\n\nPage 102 of 1019\n\n\fLimitation on Credit Hours Outside the College\nAXLE: Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education\nWhat Is Liberal Education?\nFear No Learning!\nHow to Get Started\nWhere to Get Information\nWhere to Get Advice\nWhat is AXLE?\nOverview of AXLE\nThe First-Year Writing Seminar\nThe Writing Requirement\nThe Liberal Arts Requirement\nThe Major\nAXLE Curriculum Course Distribution\nAXLE, the Major, and the Optional Minor\nAdvanced Placement under AXLE\nTransfer Credit under AXLE\nArea of Concentration\nMajor Field\nDefined Interdisciplinary Programs\nDeclaration of the Area of Concentration\nIndividually Designed Interdisciplinary Majors\nDouble and Triple Majors\nApproved Second Majors Outside the College\n\nThe Bachelor of Arts\nThe bachelor of arts degree is granted upon successful completion of the following five requirements:\n1. At least 120 semester hours of creditable college work,\n2. A final grade point average of at least 2.000,\n3. Completion of the AXLE requirements,\n4. Completion of one of the options listed under Area of Concentration,\n5. Completion of at least 102 credit hours of course work within the College of Arts and Science, or a minimum\nof 90 credit hours for those students with a second major outside the College of Arts and Science.\nLimitation on Credit Hours outside the College\nCandidates for the bachelor of arts degree must successfully complete a minimum of 102 credit hours within the\nCollege of Arts and Science. Students who are completing an approved second major from one of the other schools\nwithin Vanderbilt are required to complete 90 credit hours within the College of Arts and Science for the bachelor of\narts degree.\n\nPage 103 of 1019\n\n\fAXLE: Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education\nThe Arts and Science core program of study—known as AXLE—is anchored in intensive practice in writing and a\ndiverse thirteen-course component of classes that has been designed to allow maximum choice in course selection\n(based on student interests and achievement levels). At the same time, the distribution requirements of AXLE\nensure that students will explore intellectually and academically the breadth of possibilities represented by the\nliberal arts.\n\nWhat Is Liberal Education?\nThe study of the liberal arts—what is historically called a liberal education—is the oldest and most venerable form of\nhigher education. It has proved itself perennially flexible and adaptive over the past centuries, and it remains the\nsingle best educational preparation for further, specialized study in the professions (medicine, law, education,\nbusiness, et al.), as well as for doctoral work in the humanities and social sciences and advanced research in the\nsciences. The holistic focus of a liberal education encompasses all areas of human knowledge: the natural and social\nsciences, mathematics, foreign languages and cultures, the arts, and the humanities. The empirical disciplines guide\nus in our efforts to live most productively and efficiently. But the rest of the curriculum—the humanities and the arts\n—makes it possible to reflect upon the right use of the remarkable scientific knowledge we have acquired. In a\nliberal arts education, content is always considered in its larger context. Thus, the reflective and discursive aspects\nof study in the liberal arts call upon students to move beyond the mere acquisition of information to inquire into the\ndeeper issues within their studies, and to connect their learning across disciplines and cultures as they live and work\nin the communal environment of Vanderbilt. The end product of a successful liberal arts education is a thoughtful\ncitizen who is prepared to take up his or her rights and responsibilities in a democratic society, to analyze and\ncritique received information, to articulate the issues at hand or the personal values at stake, and whose intellectual\nlife is marked by ongoing internal dialogue about the quality and meaning of life for him or her, as well as for the\ncommunity at large.\n\nFear No Learning!\nThe interdisciplinary inclination of many courses in the College of Arts and Science is an ideal training ground for\nlearning new methodologies for problem solving in the complex, global world of the 21st century. Here, students\nmay work with biologists and psychologists in the Neuroscience program; study with creative writers, sociologists,\nhistorians, or cinema and media arts scholars in the African American and Diaspora Studies program; or take a class,\nteam taught, by professors from the School of Music and the Department of English in the College of Arts and\nScience. Over the course of a Vanderbilt education, students challenge themselves with the academic demands of\nthe classes they select, and are challenged by new ideas and unfamiliar ways of looking at issues. Exploring beyond\nthe boundaries of one’s intellectual comfort zone in order to admit new ideas is one of the most important aspects of\nhigher education. The time and effort devoted to selecting thoughtfully the courses that will satisfy AXLE\nrequirements prepare students for the more specialized study that they undertake in their major (or majors).\n\nHow to Get Started\nThe program of studies is divided approximately into thirds:\n\n1/3 — courses to meet the requirements of the Writing and Liberal Arts requirements;\n1/3 — courses required to complete the chosen major;\n1/3 — electives, which will complete the 120 credit hours required for graduation.\n\nThese divisions are approximate and may differ for individual students.\n\nFor a student’s first semester, most selections should be from the first group, courses that will fulfill the Writing and\n\nPage 104 of 1019\n\n\fLiberal Arts requirements. Academic background, career goals, and general talents and interests will affect choice of\ncourses.\n\nUpon graduation, students in the College of Arts and Science will receive a bachelor of arts degree upon completion\nof the other four requirements in addition to AXLE: fulfillment of requirements for one major, a 2.000 average in the\nmajor, 120 cumulative earned credit hours, and a 2.000 average overall.\n\nWhere to Get Information\nIn addition to this catalog’s sections on the rules, regulations, and policies of the College of Arts and Science as well\nas descriptions of the academic programs of all the undergraduate schools, students may refer to the booklet,\nUnderstanding Your Core Curriculum & Pre-major Advising, a College of Arts and Science manual for entering\nstudents.\n\nWhere to Get Advice\nEntering students are assigned pre-major advisers from CASPAR (College of Arts and Science Pre-major Academic\nAdvising Resources Center). Pre-major advisers are carefully selected and receive intensive training on how to help\nstudents proceed effectively through the requirements of AXLE and chart a course of study. These advisers will\ncounsel students through their first three and one-half semesters or until they declare a major. At that time,\nstudents are assigned faculty advisers in their major departments. Students are encouraged to see their advisers at\nany time; they must, however, consult their pre-major adviser three times during the first year: during summer\nbefore the fall semester, prior to the opening of enrollment windows for the spring semester, and prior to the\nopening of enrollment windows for the fall semester of their second year. Prior to their first semester, entering firstyear students must consult in June with their pre-major adviser who will assist with course selections for registration\nfor the fall and begin to understand each student’s interests and goals. (This initial contact is typically via phone\nand/or email.)\n\nWhat Is AXLE?\nAXLE is the acronym for Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education. It is the core curriculum that all students in the\nCollege of Arts and Science must fulfill. The AXLE curriculum is flexible and very user-friendly. It consists of two\nparts: the Writing Requirement and the Liberal Arts Requirement.\nThe Writing Requirement has four segments: completion of English 1100 or demonstration of basic skills in English\ncomposition; completion of a First-Year Writing Seminar; completion of a writing course (indicated by a “W”) no later\nthan the fourth semester in residence; and completion of a second writing course (indicated by a “W”) or an\napproved course in oral communication (CMST 2100, 2110, or 2120).\nThe Liberal Arts Requirement is composed of a total of thirteen courses taken at Vanderbilt, and distributed across\nsix categories. The First-Year Writing Seminar and all writing courses, and approved Oral Communication courses\nare also counted in the thirteen-course Liberal Arts Requirement.\n1. The Writing Requirement (three to four courses)\na. English Composition ENGL 1100 (appropriate test score or one course)\nb. First-Year Writing Seminar (one course)\nc. a W course before the end of the fourth semester (one course)\nd. a second W course or approved Oral Communication course (one course)\n2. The Liberal Arts Requirement (13 courses)\na. HCA — Humanities and the Creative Arts (three courses)\nb. INT — International Cultures (three courses)\nc. US — History and Culture of the United States (one course)\nd. MNS — Mathematics and Natural Sciences (three courses)\ne. SBS — Social and Behavioral Sciences (two courses)\nf. P — Perspectives (one course)\nAll students must also complete requirements for at least one major (between 27 and 48 credit hours of course\n\nPage 105 of 1019\n\n\fwork) and earn a minimum number of 120 earned credit hours in order to graduate.\n\nOverview of AXLE\nAXLE consists of two parts: the Writing Requirement (including a First-Year Writing Seminar) and the Liberal Arts\nRequirement.\n\nThe First-Year Writing Seminar\nThe First-Year Writing Seminar is an integral part of the first-year experience in the College of Arts and Science.\nThrough these seminars, first-year students engage in independent learning and inquiry in an environment in which\nthey can express knowledge and defend opinions through intensive class discussion, oral presentations, and written\nexpression. The small-group nature of these seminars allows for direct student-faculty interaction that stresses\ntraining in techniques of scholarly inquiry. The students’ written work and oral presentations are subject to\nthoughtful critical review by the faculty member, providing feedback that can be used to reconsider the manner in\nwhich they articulate their ideas and to refine their skills in these areas. Thus, first-year students learn not only\nabout the subject matter of the seminar, but are also exposed to new methods of acquiring knowledge, different\nways of expressing and sharing ideas, and unique opportunities to participate in critical inquiry.\n\nAll first-year students must enroll in a First-Year Writing Seminar. (First-Year Writing Seminars in the College of Arts\nand Science are numbered 1111.) This course may be taken during the fall or the spring semester. Students are\npermitted to enroll in only one First-Year Writing Seminar per semester. All First-Year Writing Seminars also count in\ntheir appropriate distribution areas within the Liberal Arts Requirement, but a second seminar will not count toward\nthe writing requirement. Students who transfer into the College of Arts and Science (whether from another school at\nVanderbilt or from another college or university) do not complete a First-Year Writing Seminar. Students beyond\ntheir second semester in residence may not register for First-Year Writing Seminars, nor may First- Year Writing\nSeminars be repeated after completion of the second semester in residence.\n\nThe Writing Requirement\nExcellent communication skills, including the ability to articulate ideas and defend positions in writing, will be\nparamount for the 21st-century graduates of Vanderbilt University; therefore, all students in the College of Arts and\nScience must successfully complete the Writing Requirement.\na. All students must demonstrate competence in English composition. Appropriate skills in composition are\nessential to successful progress at the Competence is demonstrated by completion of ENGL 1100 or any of\nthe following test-based or transfer-credit satisfiers:\ni. SAT: Combined score of at least 1220 on the Writing and Critical Reasoning sections, with a minimum\nscore of 500 on each (test taken prior to March 2016).\nii. SAT: Score of at least 660 on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section.\niii. ACT: Score of at least 30 on the English portion (beginning October 2016).\niv. AP: Minimum score of 4 on the English Language or English Literature exam.\nv. IB: Minimum score of 6 on the Higher level English\nvi. Transfer credit for English 1100\nvii. Transfer credit for English 1210W, 1220W, 1230W, 1250W, 1260W, 1270W, or 1300W. (If used to\nsatisfy the English composition requirement, the transfer credit does NOT also count as the W course\nrequired to achieve junior standing.\nb. First-Year Writing Seminar (see above).\nc. All students must successfully complete at least one Arts and Science writing course (indicated by a “W”) at\nVanderbilt University, regardless of AP or IB credits, SAT scores, or ACT scores earned prior to matriculation.\nThe 1000-level writing-intensive courses emphasize general writing skills within the context of disciplinespecific subject matter. The 2000 and higher-level writing-intensive courses foster advanced, disciplinespecific writing skills. Departments or programs that offer these courses determine their specific writing In\n2000 or higher-level W courses, continued attention to the process of writing is included in the classroom.\nStudents receive regular feedback on their writing that will contribute toward enhancing writing skills\nappropriate to specific disciplines. The process of revising written work allows students to reflect on the\nwriting process; writing tutorials may also be included. All students are required to complete a W course\n\nPage 106 of 1019\n\n\f(other than ENGL 1100 or a First-Year Writing Seminar) no later than the fourth semester. All Arts and\nScience W courses also count in their appropriate distribution areas within the Liberal Arts Requirement.\nd. All students must successfully complete either a second Arts and Science W course (other than ENGL 1100 or\na First-Year Writing Seminar), or an approved course in oral communication (CMST 2100, 2110, 2120) at\nVanderbilt University, regardless of AP or IB credits, SAT scores, or ACT scores earned prior to Oral\ncommunication courses focus on developing improved public speaking skills. These courses introduce\nstudents to the principles and practices of public discourse and reasoned argument. Attention to the process\nof effective oral communication is integral to these classes. Students receive regular speaking assignments\nthroughout the semester and regular feedback to enhance effective speaking skills. All students must\ncomplete Part d of the Writing Requirement before graduation.\n\nThe Liberal Arts Requirement\nThe Liberal Arts Requirement consists of successful completion of thirteen courses from the College of Arts and\nScience. Most courses in the College of Arts and Science fulfill one of these Liberal Arts requirements. Courses must\ncarry three or more credits to count toward the AXLE Liberal Arts Requirement. Although some courses may be\nappropriate to more than one requirement, each course will fulfill only one requirement. These thirteen courses\nmust be distributed as outlined below. They must be taken from at least seven departments or subject areas.\n\na. Humanities and the Creative Arts — HCA (3 courses)\nCourses in the humanities and the creative arts challenge students to examine their personal understanding of life\nand how their individual experiences overlap with those of the rest of humankind. These courses testify to the\nvarying ways in which people think, form values, confront ambiguity, express spiritual and aesthetic yearnings, and\ngrapple with moral and ethical problems. By analyzing and interpreting literary, philosophical, religious, or artistic\nworks, students examine the foundations of human experience. By producing original artistic works in imaginative\nwriting, studio art, theatre, film, music, and dance, students have the opportunity to connect the universal sources\nof human inspiration with their own creative processes.\n\nb. International Cultures — INT (3 courses)\nThe study of international cultures provides students with a basis for understanding the diversity of experiences and\nvalues in our contemporary, global society. Options in this category include not only international history and\ncultural studies courses, but also courses in literature, cinema and media arts, the social sciences, art, music, and\nlanguages. Students may satisfy this requirement by choosing courses that focus on the history and culture of a\nsingle society or time period in human history and/or that represent a broad spectrum of different human societies\nand time periods.\nLanguage courses introduce students to the language of a different culture and provide insight into that culture in\nways that are not possible to achieve through detached study. At intermediate and advanced levels, students are\nable to explore the culture in depth, using the language itself to read, discuss, and write about its various aspects.\nEven at the most basic level, exposure to the language of a different culture prepares students to think and act in\nterms of living in a global community.\n\nIntermediate and advanced language courses prepare students for study abroad programs, which the College of\nArts and Science strongly recommends. A maximum of one course in this requirement may be satisfied through\nstudy abroad in a Vanderbilt-approved program. A summer study abroad program must earn 6 or more credit hours\nto satisfy this requirement.\n\nThe Global Education Office maintains a list of pre-approved programs.\n\nNote: All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt’s international security\nprovider. Registration is completed on your behalf if you enroll in a program offered through the Global Education\nOffice. Otherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.\n\nPage 107 of 1019\n\n\fAll students must complete three courses in this category, irrespective of previous language study or proficiency in\na language other than English. At least one of the three courses presented in fulfillment of this category must be a\nsecond-semester (or higher) language acquisition class taught at Vanderbilt University (or through the Duke–UVa–\nVanderbilt Partnership for Less Commonly Taught Languages), unless the student successfully demonstrates\nproficiency in a language other than English at or above the level achieved by second-semester language\nacquisition classes taught at Vanderbilt University. Students may demonstrate proficiency in a number of ways: SAT\nSubject Test scores (French, 540; German, 470; Hebrew, 530; Italian, 540; Japanese with Listening, 440; Latin, 530;\nSpanish, 520); by appropriate score on proficiency tests (written and oral) administered by the Tennessee Language\nCenter; or with AP or IB credit in a foreign language. The first semester of an introductory language acquisition class\nin any language a student has studied for at least two years in high school, or in which a student transfers credit\nfrom another institution, cannot be used in partial fulfillment of this requirement. Intensive elementary language\ncourses that cover the content of two semesters in one shall count as one course toward this category.\n\nStudents who, because of special ability and achievement, are admitted to the College of Arts and Science without\nthe normally required two years of one foreign language in high school must enroll in a foreign language course\nduring their first semester and must remain continuously enrolled until they successfully complete a full year of one\nforeign language. They must complete this requirement by the end of their fourth semester in the College of Arts\nand Science.\n\nc. History and Culture of the United States — US (1 course)\nThe study of the history and culture of the United States provides students with a basis for understanding the\nAmerican experience and the shaping of American values and viewpoints within the context of an increasingly global\nsociety. Interpreting history and culture in the broadest sense, options in this category include traditional history and\ncultural studies courses, but also courses in literature, cinema and media arts, the social sciences, art, and music,\nwhich illuminate historical periods or cultural themes in United States history. Students may satisfy this requirement\nby choosing a course that focuses on the history and culture of a single social group or time period in American\nhistory and/or that represents a broad spectrum of different social groups and time periods.\n\nd. Mathematics and Natural Sciences — MNS (3 courses, one of which must be a laboratory science)\nCourses in mathematics emphasize quantitative reasoning and prepare students to describe, manipulate, and\nevaluate complex or abstract ideas or arguments with precision. Skills in mathematical and quantitative reasoning\nprovide essential foundations for the study of natural and social sciences. Students are generally introduced to\nmathematical reasoning through the study of introductory courses in calculus or probability and statistics.\n\nCourses in the natural sciences engage students in hypothesis-driven quantitative reasoning that helps to explain\nnatural phenomena, the roles of testing and replication of experimental results, and the processes through which\nscientific hypotheses and theories are developed, modified, or abandoned in the face of more complete evidence, or\nintegrated into more general conceptual structures. Laboratory science courses engage students in methods of\nexperimental testing of hypotheses and analysis of data that are the hallmarks of the natural sciences. Natural\nscience courses prepare students to understand the complex interactions between science, technology, and society;\nteach students to apply scientific principles to everyday experience; and develop the capacity to distinguish\nbetween science and what masquerades as science.\n\ne. Social and Behavioral Sciences — SBS (2 courses)\nSocial scientists endeavor to study human behavior at the levels of individuals, their interactions with others, their\nsocietal structures, and their social institutions. The remarkable scope represented by these disciplines extends\nfrom studying the underpinnings of brain function to the dynamics of human social groups to the structures of\npolitical and economic institutions. The methods employed by social scientists are correspondingly broad, involving\napproaches as varied as mapping brain activity, discovering and charting ancient cultures, identifying the societal\nforces that shape individual and group behavior, and using mathematics to understand economic phenomena. By\nstudying how humans and societies function, students will learn about individual and societal diversity, growth, and\nchange.\n\nPage 108 of 1019\n\n\ff. Perspectives — P (1 course)\nCourses in Perspectives give significant attention to individual and cultural diversity, multicultural interactions,\nsexual orientation, gender, racial, ethical, and religious issues within a culture across time or between cultures,\nthereby extending the principles and methods associated with the liberal arts to the broader circumstances in which\nstudents live. These courses emphasize the relationship of divergent ethics and moral values to contemporary social\nissues and global conflicts.\n\nThe Major\nAll students must successfully complete a course of study leading to one of the approved major programs in the\nCollege of Arts and Science, or successfully complete an individually designed interdisciplinary major designed in\nconsultation with College of Arts and Science faculty and approved by the Committee on Individual Programs in the\nCollege of Arts and Science.\n\nAXLE Curriculum Course Distribution\nThe distribution of Arts and Science courses into AXLE categories is available in YES. Using the advanced-classsearch dialog box, use the pull-down menu under “Class Attributes” to select an AXLE category.\n\nAXLE, the Major, and the Optional Minor\nCourses used to satisfy requirements of AXLE may also be used to satisfy requirements of the major or the optional\nminor.\n\nAdvanced Placement under AXLE\nWith the exception of basic English composition and the foreign language proficiency requirements, no AXLE\nrequirement may be fulfilled with any form of advanced placement credit (AP, IB, A-level, etc.).\n\nTransfer Credit under AXLE\nGenerally, only courses taken in the College of Arts and Science may be used toward AXLE; however, any college\ncourse credit earned prior to graduation from high school, and transfer credit earned before admission to\nVanderbilt, may be used toward fulfilling AXLE requirements.\n\nArea of Concentration\nDuring the junior and senior years, much of the student’s work is concentrated in one large unit of intellectually\nrelated courses. The program of concentration may be arranged through a single major, an interdisciplinary major,\nor a double major. Each of the three options is described below. A triple major may be declared with the approval of\nthe Administrative Committee.\n\nMajor Field\nUnder this plan, the student majors in one of the recognized fields. There shall not be fewer than 27 credit hours in\nthe major field, but a given department may require up to 48 credit hours. Students may take more than the\nrequired number of credit hours in any major; any given department, however, may limit the total permissible credit\n\nPage 109 of 1019\n\n\fhours in a discipline.\n\nFor graduation, a student must have achieved a grade point average of at least 2.000 in all classes taken in the\nmajor. This set of courses includes all courses a student takes in the department or program of the major and all\ncourses a student takes outside the department or program that may count toward the major. All courses that are\nlisted as fulfilling credit hours required for the major, as listed in the Undergraduate Catalog, are included in\ncalculating the grade point average in the major.\n\nWithin the framework of these general requirements, each department has its own policies governing major work,\nwhich are published elsewhere in this catalog or otherwise available to students.\n\nAcademic programs of the College of Arts and Science are varied and broad in scope, with departmental majors\noffered in the following fields:\n\nAfrican American and Diaspora Studies\nAnthropology\nArchitecture and the Built Environment\nArt\nAsian Studies\nBiological Sciences\nChemistry\nCinema and Media Arts\nCommunication Studies\nEarth and Environmental Sciences\nEcology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology\nEconomics\nEnglish\nEnvironmental Sociology\nFrench\nGender and Sexuality Studies\nGerman Studies\n\nHistory\nHistory of Art and Architecture\nJewish Studies\nLaw, History, and Society\nMathematics\nMedicine, Health, and Society\nMolecular and Cellular Biology\nPhilosophy\nPhysics\nPolitical Science\nPsychology\nReligious Studies\nRussian Studies\nSociology\nSpanish\nSpanish and Portuguese\nTheatre\n\nDefined Interdisciplinary Programs\nStudents may also major in defined interdisciplinary programs (listed below). There shall not be fewer than 27 credit\nhours in the major field, but a given program may require up to 48 credit hours. The student must achieve at least a\n2.000 grade point average in all work taken in the major.\n\nAmerican Studies\nBiochemistry and Chemical Biology\nClassical and Mediterranean Studies\nCommunication of Science and Technology\nEconomics and History\nEuropean Studies\nEuropean Studies: Russia and Eastern Europe\nFrench and European Studies\n\nGerman and European Studies\nItalian and European Studies\nLatin American Studies\nLatino and Latina Studies\nNeuroscience\nPublic Policy Studies\nSpanish and European Studies\n\nPage 110 of 1019\n\n\fStudents may combine an interdisciplinary major with a major in one of the recognized fields listed at the beginning\nof this section.\n\nDeclaration of the Area of Concentration\nStudents may formally declare a major at any time during the third semester of residence and must do so no later\nthan the Friday before Spring Break of the fourth semester. The student selects a department or interdisciplinary\nprogram and contacts that department or program for assignment to an adviser. Students who wish to develop an\nindividually designed interdisciplinary program apply to the associate dean who chairs the Committee on Individual\nPrograms.\n\nEach fall a program is arranged that provides for consultation of sophomores with department chairs, for the\npurpose of helping students select a major. Sophomore students who have not declared a major should participate\nin this program if they intend to attain junior standing before the next spring.\n\nStudents should declare their intention to pursue specific majors by completing forms available in the Dean’s Office\nof Undergraduate Education as well as the various departmental and program offices. Departments and programs\nassign advisers to students who declare majors in their respective areas. Students have the responsibility to know\nand satisfy all requirements for majors that they intend to complete. When the student’s major has been registered,\naccess to the student’s academic record is transferred from the pre-major adviser to the new major adviser, with\nwhom they should work closely.\n\nStudents may not add a major(s) past the fifth class-day of the first semester of the senior year.\n\nIndividually Designed Interdisciplinary Majors\nThis plan permits students to contract for an individually designed program of concentration consisting of at least\n48 credit hours of approved work. The program is constructed around a coherent academic purpose and may draw\ntogether the academic resources of a number of departments and schools. The program’s purpose may include\ntopical, period, or area studies, and must be consistent with the philosophy underlying a liberal arts education (see\nthe “What is Liberal Education?” section of this catalog). The program should not be designed with a focus on preprofessional training (e.g., pre-business, pre-law, or pre-medicine). The student may be required to achieve a\nstandard of proficiency in appropriately related areas such as foreign languages or mathematics in addition to the\n48 credit hours constituting the program of concentration.\n\nEach student must identify a major adviser who will offer advice and guidance. The major adviser must be a\nprofessor or full-time senior lecturer in the College of Arts and Science.\n\nThe student’s plan for an individually designed interdisciplinary major is a statement of required courses.\nFurthermore, because of the nature of interdisciplinary majors, all courses that have previously been included in the\nstudent’s plan are considered to be part of the major discipline. The student must achieve at least a 2.000 grade\npoint average in all courses that are (or have been) part of the plan.\n\nNormally, no more than three introductory-level courses will be counted toward the interdisciplinary major.\n\nStudents may not add a major(s) past the fifth class day of the first semester of the senior year.\n\nPage 111 of 1019\n\n\fDouble and Triple Majors\nThis program permits a student to concentrate in two or three fields, which may or may not be intellectually related.\nWith approval of the departments concerned, the student completes all of the requirements stipulated for the\nmajors. Triple majors require approval of the Administrative Committee.\n\nEach A&S major must include at least 24 credit hours that are being counted solely toward the major. This rule also\napplies to students who combine (in a double or triple major) a non-interdisciplinary major with an interdisciplinary\nmajor.\nStudents in the School of Engineering may use courses taken in the College of Arts & Science for relevant second\nmajors even if those courses also fulfill a School of Engineering degree requirement.\nApproved Second Majors Outside the College\nAll undergraduate courses, majors, and minors offered by Blair School of Music, School of Engineering, and Peabody\nCollege are approved for students in the College of Arts and Science. See the appropriate sections of the\nUndergraduate Catalog under each school for details. Arts and Science students with a second major from another\nVanderbilt undergraduate school must earn a minimum of 90 credit hours in Arts and Science. Consultation with the\nstudent’s Arts and Science major adviser is especially important.\n\nAdditional Programs in the College of Arts and Science\nThe Optional Minor\nUndergraduate Research\nStudy Abroad Programs\nPre-Professional Studies\nMedicine\nDentistry\nNursing\nArchitecture\nEngineering\nLaw\nTeacher Education\nInternships\nFinding an Internship\nInterdisciplinary Internships\nDepartmental Internships\nCost of an Internship\nCombined B.A./M.A. (4+1) Program\nPrograms of Study\nAdmissions Overview\nAdvising\n\nPage 112 of 1019\n\n\fCurriculum\nScholarships and Financial Aid\n\nFor information on the College Scholars program and departmental honors, please see the section titled Honors.\n\nThe Optional Minor\nA minor is a program within a recognized area of knowledge offering students more than a casual introduction to the\narea but less than a major in it. Although the completion of a minor is not a degree requirement, students may elect\nto complete the courses specified for one or more minors. A student who completes all designated courses in a\nminor with a grade point average of at least 2.000 will have the minor entered on the transcript at the time of\ngraduation.\n\nMinors may be combined with any departmental major or interdisciplinary major, but minors may not be earned in\nthe department or program of the major. Each minor must, however, include at least 15 credit hours that are being\ncounted solely toward the minor. Courses may not be taken on a P/F basis if they are offered in the department of\nthe minor or if they are being counted toward an interdisciplinary minor (see Academic Regulations).\n\nMinors consist of a minimum of five courses of 3 or more credit hours each. Many minors require a greater number\nof credit hours and specific courses. When a minor is offered in a discipline that offers a major, only those courses\nthat count toward the major may be counted toward the minor.\n\nStudents should refer to the appropriate sections of this catalog for specific requirements. Minors available at\npresent are listed below.\n\nStudents should declare their intention to pursue specific minors by completing forms available in the Dean’s Office\nof Undergraduate Education as well as the various departmental and program offices. Departments and programs\nassign advisers to students who declare minors in their respective areas. Students have the responsibility to know\nand satisfy all requirements for minors that they intend to complete.\n\nStudents may not add or change a minor after the final day of classes in the second semester of their senior year.\n\nOptional minors are offered in the following fields and interdisciplinary programs:\n\nPage 113 of 1019\n\n\fAfrican American and Diaspora\nStudies\nAmerican Studies\nAnthropology\nArabic Language\nArchitecture and the Built\nEnvironment\nArt\nAsian Studies\nAstronomy\n\nEnglish\nEnvironmental and Sustainability\nStudies\nEuropean Studies\nFrench\n\nMediterranean Studies\nNanoscience and Nanotechnology**\nNeuroscience\nPhilosophy\n\nGender and Sexuality Studies\n\nPhysics\n\nGerman Studies\nHistory\nHistory of Architecture\n\nBiological Sciences\n\nIslamic Studies\n\nBrazilian Studies\nChemistry\nChinese Language and Culture\nCinema and Media Arts\nCommunication of Science and\nTechnology\nCommunication Studies\nData Science*\nEarth and Environmental Sciences\n\nItalian Studies\nJapanese Language and Culture\nJewish Studies\nKorean Language and Culture\n\nPolitical Science\nPortuguese\nPsychology\nQuantum Information Science and\nEngineering\nReligious Studies\nRussian Studies\nScientific Computing**\nSociology\n\nLatin American Studies\n\nSouth Asian Language and Culture\n\nLatino and Latina Studies\nMathematics\nMedicine, Health, and Society\n\nSpanish\nSports and Society\nTheatre\n\nEconomics\n\nMediterranean Archaeology\n\nUndergraduate Business Minor ^\n\n* Administered by the four undergraduate schools\n**Administered by the School of Engineering in collaboration with the College of Arts and Science\n^Administered by the four undergraduate schools and the Owen Graduate School of Management\n\nApproved Minors Outside the College\n\nArts and Science students are permitted to pursue a second major and/or a minor that has been approved by the\nfaculties of the other Vanderbilt undergraduate schools: the Blair School of Music, the School of Engineering, and\nPeabody College of Education and Human Development. See the appropriate sections of the Undergraduate Catalog\nunder each school for details. Minors may not be earned in the department or program of the major.\n\nUndergraduate Research\nAll students have ample opportunity to participate in faculty research projects or to pursue research projects\nindependently, both on campus and at remote sites. Such research has led to the publication of coauthored or\nstudent-authored papers and other presentations to the scholarly community. Summer and academic year research\nby undergraduates in all fields may be subsidized by the university or the College of Arts and Science. Students\nshould contact the director of undergraduate studies in the field of interest for more information.\n\nStudy Abroad Programs\nVanderbilt offers study programs for all undergraduate students from Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, School\nof Engineering, and Peabody College to provide undergraduates immediate contact with cultures different from their\nown and to aid in the mastery of foreign languages. Students interested in applying for study abroad should consult\ntheir advisers to determine whether all degree requirements can be completed on schedule.\n\nPage 114 of 1019\n\n\fBrochures on all approved programs are available in the Global Education Office in Room 115, Student Life Center.\nGEO also maintains a website, vanderbilt.edu/geo. The study abroad programs are described in more detail in the\nSpecial Programs for Undergraduates section of this catalog.\n\nWhen choosing programs in a city for study abroad, College of Arts and Science students may only apply to the\nVanderbilt-approved overseas program(s). The College only accepts credit from international schools and programs\nthat have been approved by Vanderbilt faculty, and for which the University has a contract or agreement.\n\nPre-Professional Studies\nMedicine\nStudents interested in the study of medicine should plan their undergraduate programs in consultation with Dr.\nMichelle Grundy, health professions adviser. There is no formal premedical program of courses in the College of Arts\nand Science or elsewhere at Vanderbilt. Each student should plan a program to meet individual needs. The program\nshould include whatever courses may be necessary to meet medical school admission requirements, all courses\nrequired for the major, all AXLE requirements, and elective options. Students may choose majors from any of the\nfour undergraduate colleges, and may elect to pursue a double major or an interdisciplinary program of\nconcentration.\n\nA student who plans to apply for admission to the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, as well as other medical\nschools, may choose either of the following options:\n\n1. A student may qualify for admission with a B.A. degree, whether completed in three years or in four. Minimum\nrequirements for admission generally would be met by completing at least two semesters of English, four semesters\nof chemistry including organic, two semesters of biology, two semesters of physics, and at least one semester of\ncalculus/math. Since prerequisites may vary across medical schools, students are urged to consult the online\nresource, Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR) published by the American Association of Medical Schools\n(at aamc.org) for school-specific information.\n\nIn light of the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) changes that took effect in 2015, it is recommended that\nstudents take one semester of biochemistry and one semester of introductory statistics. Additionally, through course\nwork or self-directed study, students will need to be knowledgeable in basic concepts of psychology, sociology, and\nbioethics.\n\nFor more information, students are advised to visit the website of the Health Professions Advisory Office\n(vanderbilt.edu/hpao) and refer to the links for 1) “Premedical Preparation” and 2) “Threading a path through\npremedical expectations.”\n\n2. A student may qualify as a three-year student in the senior-in-absentia program (see Senior-in-Absentia in this\ncatalog).\n\nDentistry\nStudents interested in predental studies should plan their undergraduate program in consultation with Dr. Michelle\nGrundy, health professions adviser. There is no formal predental program of courses at Vanderbilt. Predental studies\nshould include courses necessary to meet dental school admission requirements, all courses required for the major,\nall AXLE requirements, and elective options. Students may choose majors from any of the four undergraduate\ncolleges. They may also elect a double major or an interdisciplinary program of concentration. A student may apply\n\nPage 115 of 1019\n\n\fto dental school under the senior-in-absentia program (see Senior-in-Absentia in this catalog) or apply for admission\nafter three years of college work without a degree.\n\nAny student contemplating application to dental school should take at least two semesters of English, four\nsemesters of chemistry including organic, two semesters of biology, two semesters of physics, and at least one\nsemester of calculus/math. Since prerequisites may vary across dental schools, students are urged to consult the\nADEA Official Guide to Dental Schools published by the American Association of Dental Schools.\n\nNursing\nStudents interested in developing a program that could lead to a master of science in nursing are advised to consult\nthe Office of Admissions in the School of Nursing.\n\nArchitecture\nUndergraduate students in the College of Arts and Science expecting to pursue architecture at the graduate level\nshould complete at least one year of analytic geometry and calculus and one year of physics. Students may select\nany major but would want to include courses that emphasize a broad sense of art and architectural history,\nincluding courses in studio art. Before applying to specific schools of architecture, they would develop a portfolio of\ncreative work. Further information is available from the pre-architecture advisers: Professor Vesna Pavlović,\nDepartment of Art, and Professor Kevin Murphy, Department of the History of Art and Architecture.\n\nEngineering\nUndergraduate students in the College of Arts and Science expecting to pursue engineering at the graduate level\nshould normally major in a natural science or mathematics and, at a minimum, should complete two years of\ncalculus or its equivalent, one year each of chemistry and physics, and at least an additional year of a natural\nscience or mathematics. A minimum of one year of computer science is highly desirable. Students should seek\nspecific information concerning admission from the engineering school of their choice as early as possible,\npreferably by the end of the sophomore year, to assure optimum preparation for entry into that school. Standards\nfor admission vary, but usually a 3.00 average or better is required.\n\nLaw\nThere is no formal program of prelaw studies at Vanderbilt. Most law schools have no specific requirements for a\nprelaw curriculum but place great emphasis on the development of the student’s ability to read and comprehend\naccurately, thoroughly, and rapidly; to speak and write clearly and correctly; to think precisely; and to analyze\ncomplex situations and weigh and appraise their several elements. The development of analytical skills and of\nmature study habits is vital. A broad cultural background is important—since law touches life at every point, every\nsubject in the college curriculum may bear on the lawyer’s work. Students interested in the study of law should plan\ntheir undergraduate programs in consultation with Dean Carrie Russell, prelaw adviser, in the Dean’s Office of\nUndergraduate Education.\n\nTeacher Education\nDetails will be found in Licensure for Teaching in the Peabody College section of this catalog.\n\nInternships\nStudents may earn academic credit for the work of internships in the College of Arts and Science on a Pass/Fail basis\n\nPage 116 of 1019\n\n\fthrough interdisciplinary or departmental internships. Credit hours earned will not count toward major or minor\nrequirements or toward AXLE, but will count as part of the total credit hours required for graduation. Students obtain\ntheir own placement and faculty adviser who works with them to develop a list of readings or research agenda for\nthe internship, which must be approved by the director of internships in the College of Arts and Science (Associate\nDean Daniel Morgan). The necessary forms for earning academic credit for an internship may be obtained from the\nDean’s Office of Undergraduate Education in 350 Buttrick Hall, although students register for internships through\ntheir respective school. The deadline for submitting registration forms to the office of Dean Jones for internship\ncourses taken during summer term and fall semester is May 1. Students expecting to intern during the spring\nsemester should submit registration forms by January 1.\n\nFinding an Internship\nStudents searching for an internship opportunity locally or elsewhere should contact the Career Center.\n\nInterdisciplinary Internships\nINDS 3880 (fall, spring), 3884 (summer). 1 credit hour (repeatable)\n\nAny student who is at least a sophomore and in good academic standing may earn one credit hour per semester or\nsummer for an internship under this designation. This course may be repeated twice for a maximum of 3 credit\nhours exclusively on a Pass/Fail basis.\n\nDepartmental Internships\nMaximum of 15 credit hours (may be taken only once)\n\nUnder this option students from any discipline may earn academic credit for internships in the departments listed\nbelow if they meet the minimum GPA requirements and have 6 credit hours of prior work in the department in which\nthey wish to intern. Students are responsible for securing a faculty adviser for the internship and developing an\nacademic plan of work for the internship opportunity, both of which must be approved by the director of\nundergraduate studies in the department in which the internship is housed. (In some instances, the DUS will serve\nas the faculty adviser for all internships taken in that discipline.) All internships under this designation are taken\nconcurrently with a research and/or readings course. The latter is taken on a graded basis and may count toward\nrequirements for a major or minor. Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies in the department\nof interest to obtain additional information about internships in that discipline.

Students will be charged for internships\ntaken during summer on the basis of the hourly tuition rate for summer school unless approved in advance to\nreceive the internship subsidy (see the Career Center website).\n\nCombined B.A./M.A. (4+1) Program\nThe College of Arts and Science offers students in many departments and programs the opportunity to earn both the\nbachelor’s degree and the master’s degree in a shorter period of time and at less cost than is normally the case.\n\nExceptional students in the College of Arts and Science can obtain both degrees in an expedited period, typically\nwithin, but not less than, five years.\nThe usual period of study for both the bachelor’s and the master’s degree is six years. Through the 4+1 option, the\nstudent and her or his adviser plan a five-year program of study. It is important to note that there is no provision for\nobtaining both degrees in a period shorter than five years. The program is intended for selected students for whom\nthe master’s degree is sufficient preparation for their career goals, is desirable as a goal in itself, or is viewed as\nadditional preparation before pursuing a doctorate or a professional degree.\n\nThe areas of study available for the Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) option within Arts and Science are determined by\nindividual departments and programs, which also determine the policies and guidelines to be followed. Students will\nbe admitted to the Combined B.A./M.A. program only by the invitation and the approval of the department or\nprogram.\n\nPrograms of Study\n\nPage 118 of 1019\n\n\fThe 4+1 option is currently available in the following departments and programs: English; French; German; History;\nHistory of Art and Architecture; Latin American Studies; Mathematics; Medicine, Health, and Society; Philosophy;\nPolitical Science; and Psychology. Students are welcome to discuss the Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) option with any of\nthese departments and programs.\n\nAdmissions Overview\nThe Combined B.A./M.A program allows Vanderbilt University students to study for both degrees typically, but not\nnecessarily, in the same department. Undergraduates with strong academic records may apply for admission to the\nprogram after the first semester of their junior year. Qualifying students are normally accepted into the program in\nthe second semester of the junior year.\n\nTo apply for admission, students will first consult with the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education (350 Buttrick\nHall), and then submit to the prospective graduate department or program a “Petition to Apply to the Combined\nB.A./M.A. (4+1) Degree Program” (available at as.vanderbilt.edu/academics/specialdegree/4plus1.php), a statement\nof purpose, a formal application to the Graduate School, a preliminary program proposal, two letters of\nrecommendation from Vanderbilt faculty, and a current transcript. Application forms are available for download or\ncan be completed online at vanderbilt.edu/gradschool. GRE scores or other admissions requirements may be\nspecified by the prospective department. Admission to the 4+1 option is highly selective. An accomplished\nacademic record, a demonstrated commitment to pursue graduate study, and a strong endorsement from\nVanderbilt faculty are key elements to the successful applicant. Students will be provisionally accepted as graduate\nstudents, pending completion of all undergraduate requirements. Graduate student status will apply in the fifth\nyear.\n\nAdvising\nProspective students should discuss with one of their advisers general information on the program and whether this\nprogram is appropriate to their long-term goals. All students are encouraged to discuss their plans and goals with\ntheir undergraduate pre-major and major adviser. Especially in cases where the intended graduate program differs\nfrom the undergraduate major, the student is further encouraged to seek advice from the advisers in the graduate\nprogram.\n\nCurriculum\nStudents in a 4+1 program must satisfy all requirements for both degrees. Advanced Placement (AP) credits will\noften be used toward satisfying general curriculum requirements, for a maximum of 18 credit hours. The principal\ndistinction between this program and the standard graduate program is two-fold: (1) students are allowed to take\nmaster’s courses while completing the bachelor’s degree, and (2) students are thereby enabled to complete both\ndegrees within five years.\n\nIn order to complete the program in five years, students will be expected to complete most, if not all, of the\nrequirements for their undergraduate degree by the end of the first semester of the senior year. Until all\nbaccalaureate requirements are fulfilled, the student will follow College of Arts and Science undergraduate policies\nand procedures. It is also suggested that students begin taking graduate courses toward the master’s degree in the\nsecond semester of the senior year. Most graduate programs participating in this option have a non-thesis plan of\nstudy requiring 30 graduate credit hours in addition to the requirements for the undergraduate degree. An average\nload per semester as a graduate student is 9–12 credit hours.\n\nScholarships and Financial Aid\nStudents who are receiving scholarships or other forms of financial aid as a Vanderbilt undergraduate are advised\nthat such aid applies in most cases only toward the completion of the bachelor’s degree or the first four years of\ntheir studies (which may include their taking some graduate courses during their senior year). Students wishing to\n\nPage 119 of 1019\n\n\fpursue the 4+1 option should seek support for their fifth year of study through student loans and other financial aid.\n\nFor additional information, contact A&S Deans’ Office, 350 Buttrick Hall, or consult the website\nas.vanderbilt.edu/academics/specialdegree/4plus1.php .\n\nHonors in the College of Arts and Science\nFounder's Medal\nLatin Honors Designation\nCollege Scholars Program\nDepartmental Honors\nDean's List\nPhi Beta Kappa\nHonor Societies for First-Year Students\nOther Awards and Prizes\nFounder’s Medal\nThe Founder’s Medal, signifying first honors, was endowed by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt as one of his gifts to\nthe university. The recipient is named by the Dean after consideration of faculty recommendations and overall\nacademic achievements, as well as grade point averages of the year’s highest ranking summa cum laude graduates.\n\nLatin Honors Designation\nHonors noted on diplomas and published in the Commencement program are earned as follows:\n\nSumma Cum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the top 5 percent of the previous\nthree years’ Arts and Science graduating seniors.\nMagna Cum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the next 8 percent of the previous\nthree years’ Arts and Science graduating seniors.\nCum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the next 12 percent of the previous three\nyears’ Arts and Science graduating seniors.\n\nCollege Scholars Program\nThe College Scholars Program is the honors program for the College of Arts and Science. All first-year students in the\nCollege of Arts & Science are invited to apply at the end of their first semester. Students are selected to participate\nin the College Scholars program based on their academic record and achievements from their first semester on\ncampus. These students have the opportunity to pursue advanced scholarly work in honors seminars and enriched\ncourses or independent-studies projects. The College Scholars program is open only to Arts and Science students.\n\nCollege Scholars may achieve the designation “Honors in the College of Arts and Science” on their diplomas by\nacquiring fifteen “honors points” in the program. The honors points system encourages breadth and depth. Students\naccomplish these goals by taking honors seminars in several AXLE categories and by doing independent projects\n(independent studies, enriching courses, departmental honors research, internships, service, and creative projects).\nA maximum of thirteen points may be earned in honors seminars, and a minimum of two research projects must be\ncompleted to earn fifteen points. Students must earn a grade of “B” or better in classes that earn honors points. To\nremain in good standing in the program, students must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.000.\n\nPage 120 of 1019\n\n\fFurther information on the College Scholars program and honors in the College of Arts and Science may be obtained\nfrom Associate Dean Dan Morgan.\n\nDepartmental Honors\nTo encourage individual development and independent study within their field, many departments and\ninterdisciplinary programs of the College of Arts and Science offer honors programs for selected, superior\ncandidates. Students often begin departmental honors work in the junior year, but some projects start in the senior\nyear. To qualify for consideration, students must have (a) attained a minimum grade point average of 3.300 in all\nwork previously taken for credit and in the major, and (b) exhibited to the department(s) and/or interdisciplinary\nprogram(s) other evidence of the student’s capacity for independent study. Some departments and interdisciplinary\nprograms require higher grade point averages in all work previously taken for credit and/or in the major. Formal\nadmission is by the director of honors study in the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education after nomination by\nthe department(s) and/or interdisciplinary program(s) concerned.\n\nRequirements to complete departmental honors vary from department to department (see descriptions in the\nappropriate department sections of this catalog). Candidates are required to demonstrate some degree of originality\nand maturity in the methods of independent investigation, analysis, and criticism, and skill in the written\npresentation of independent work. This standard usually requires a senior thesis but may be satisfied, in\ndepartments that have gained approval of this procedure, by a series of briefer critical papers.\n\nDepartmental honors work culminates in an examination given in the second semester of the senior year. The\nexamination shall be both oral and written except in departments where honors students must take all courses\nrequired of standard majors in addition to those required of honors students. These departments have the option of\nmaking the examination either oral or both oral and written. The examination shall be conducted by a committee\nwith a majority of examiners who have not participated in the candidate’s honors work. Where feasible, examiners\nfrom other institutions may be included. The examination shall cover the thesis and specific fields of the\nindependent work and may, at the discretion of the department, include all of the major work. Successful candidates\nare awarded honors or highest honors in their field, and this designation appears on their diplomas.\n\nDean’s List\nThe Dean’s List recognizes outstanding academic performance in a semester. Students are named to the Dean’s List\nwhen they earn a grade point average of at least 3.500 while carrying 12 or more graded credit hours, with no\ntemporary or missing grades in any course (credit or non-credit), and no grade of F. A student must be in a degreegranting school.\n\nPhi Beta Kappa\nThe Alpha Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in the state of Tennessee honors scholarly attainments in the liberal arts and\nsciences and annually elects seniors and juniors to membership during the spring semester.\n\nSeniors who have completed at least 60 credit hours in the College of Arts and Science and earned a cumulative\ngrade point average of 3.65 or higher are eligible for consideration, as are juniors who have completed at least 70\ncredit hours at Vanderbilt with a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.90. Juniors must have completed most\nAXLE requirements by the end of their junior year. For calculating credit hours and judging residence requirements,\nthe chapter treats foreign study programs in the same manner as does the College of Arts and Science.\n\nAttainment of the minimum required grade point average does not guarantee election. Membership in Phi Beta\nKappa is based on a demonstration of scholarly achievements, broad cultural interests, and high moral character.\n\nPage 121 of 1019\n\n\fThe scholarly work must emphasize liberal rather than applied or professional studies. As a guideline, for seniors at\nleast 90 credit hours must qualify as liberal. Grades earned in applied (vocational) or professional course work are\nnot counted in computing the grade point average. The breadth of a candidate’s program, as shown by the number\nand variety of courses taken outside the major, is also considered.\n\nPhi Beta Kappa has long emphasized the importance of mathematics and foreign language in a liberal education. In\nkeeping with this tradition, the chapter considers only those students who have demonstrated proficiency in these\nareas beyond the AXLE graduation requirements. Proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking a foreign language is\ntypically demonstrated by passing a course in a language at a level at least one semester beyond the AXLE\nrequirements. Courses must be taken on a graded rather than a P/F basis. The foreign language requirement may\nbe satisfied with College Board SAT Subject, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or Tennessee\nLanguage Center test scores.\n\nMathematics proficiency may be demonstrated by completing two semesters of calculus or one semester of calculus\nand one semester of statistics. Courses must be taken on a graded rather than a P/F basis. The mathematics\nrequirement may be satisfied with Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A-Level exam credit, but\nnot College Board SAT Subject test scores.\n\nIn no event may the total number of persons elected from any senior class exceed 10 percent of the class, and from\nany junior class exceed six persons. Eligible juniors who are not elected are reconsidered for membership in their\nsenior year.\n\nRefer to the chapter website my.vanderbilt.edu/phibetakappa for additional information and detailed eligibility\ncriteria.\n\nHonor Societies for First-Year Students\nFirst-year students who earn a grade point average of 3.500 or better for their first semester are eligible for\nmembership in the Vanderbilt chapters of Phi Eta Sigma and Alpha Lambda Delta.\n\nOther Awards and Prizes\nMORRIS H.

Graduates of the Blair School are recognized as superior artists and scholars distinguished by their global\nmindsets, broad interdisciplinary competencies, and unyielding commitments to advocacy, entrepreneurship, and\neducation.\n\nThe Blair School has been an integral part of Nashville’s musical environment since its founding in 1964 by the Justin\nand Valere Potter Foundation through a bequest of Valere Blair Potter. In 1981 the school was merged with\nVanderbilt following the university’s decision to develop an excellent program in music. Studies leading to the\nprofessional bachelor of music in performance were initiated in 1986.\n\nThe Bachelor of Music degree program includes majors in performance, composition, jazz studies, and integrated\nstudies. The performance major is available in any orchestral instrument, piano, saxophone, euphonium, and voice.\nThe major in composition emphasizes analytical skills as well as the development of students’ creativity. The jazz\nstudies major offers a focus on American and non-Western music traditions while also developing the core\nfundamentals of Western music common to all Blair majors. The integrated studies major combines the study of\ncomposition or a performance area with an additional concentration in music and forms the basis for a five-year\nprogram in teacher education offered cooperatively with Peabody College. In the Bachelor of Musical Arts degree\nprogram, composers and performers complete an in-depth music study in addition to a field outside of music.\n\nA non-professional 31-hour liberal arts music major makes it possible for students outside the Blair School to choose\nmusic as a second major. Students in other schools and colleges of the university also may pursue a minor in music,\nmusic composition, musicology/ethnomusicology, or music performance. And Blair offers a remarkable variety of\nelectives for students who wish to enrich their studies with credit in music courses, ensembles, or performance\ninstruction, or to select music as an extracurricular activity.\n\nPage 128 of 1019\n\n\fBlair School of Music is home to internationally known faculty soloists and ensembles, and Blair’s performers,\ncomposers, ethnomusicologists, and musicologists are among the most respected in their fields. Members of the\nfaculty ensembles provide private performance instruction and coach chamber music ensembles and performance\nclasses. The faculty's dedication to teaching and a low student/faculty ratio provide students the personal attention\nthat fosters maximum musical growth and understanding. The school is committed to its goal of developing students\nwho are among the most articulate, culturally aware, and artistically sensitive of any graduates in the country.\n\nFacilities\nThe Blair building incorporates innovative developments in acoustical design and engineering. It contains teaching\nstudios and faculty offices, classrooms, rehearsal halls, practice rooms, library, administrative offices, technology\nand keyboard labs, and concert venues. The 272-seat Steve and Judy Turner Recital Hall is the locus for student\nrecitals and concerts and master classes by faculty members and visiting artists held on a regular basis. It also\nhouses the Dobson Organ Opus 92 (2014), designed in the tradition of eighteenth-century eastern German organs\nnot unlike those Bach knew, with additions and accommodations for twenty-first century use. Opened in spring\n2002, the 609-seat Ingram Hall garnered immediate acclaim for its superb acoustics, its visual beauty, and its\nenhancement of the school’s ability to host and produce orchestra, opera, and other major concert events.\n\nThe Anne Potter Wilson Music Library is a division of the Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries. The collection, begun\nin 1947, was moved from Peabody College to its new and permanent home at Blair in the summer of 1985. Named\nto honor Anne Potter Wilson by the Vanderbilt Board of Trust in 1987, the 12,000-square-foot library holds more\nthan 116,000 books, scores, sound and video recordings, and subscriptions to journals and online music databases.\nIt is equipped with a seminar room, listening and viewing stations, computer workstations, and study facilities. A\nvariety of equipment is available for check out including laptops, microphones, phone chargers, midi keyboards,\nheadphones, and umbrellas. Music librarians and staff are available to assist users with music research and finding\nresources for performance, study, or instruction.\n\nThe Blair Concert Series\nThe Blair Concert Series offers a broad array of music performances to the university community and the region.\nNational and international artists and ensembles, the Blair faculty, including resident ensembles and soloists, and\nstudent ensembles and performers are all featured. All student recitals are open to the public. More than 350\nconcerts are presented at the school each year, and most are free of charge, as a gift to the community.\n\nA milestone in the Blair School's history was “The Blair Commissions: Music for the 21st Century,” a project funded\nby the James Stephen Turner Family Charitable Foundation, which has commissioned several important works by\nrenowned composers from 2005 through 2019. These include works by Susan Botti and Peter Schickele and four\nmajor works by Michael Hersch. Each composition received its premiere in Nashville, and all the works were then\neither recorded or performed in New York. The project has served two intertwined missions: to promote the\ncomposition of outstanding works by the world’s leading composers and to invite attention to the excellent\nensembles and faculty performers of Vanderbilt University.\n\nComposers-in-residence who have visited the Blair School include Robert Beaser, William Bolcom, Susan Botti,\nGeorge Crumb, Michael Daugherty, Lukas Foss, Gabriela Lena Frank, John Harbison, Michael Hersch, Karel Husa,\nSteven Mackey, Donald Martino, Cindy McTee, Jessie Montgomery, Kevin Puts, Christopher Rouse, Adam\nSchoenberg, Joseph Schwantner, Frank Ticheli, Michael Torke, and Joan Tower.\n\nBlair Academy at Vanderbilt\nIndividual, group, class, and ensemble instruction for precollege and adult students (defined as students above high\nschool age not receiving university credit) is offered through the Blair Academy at Vanderbilt. Course offerings are\navailable at blair.vanderbilt.edu/blair-academy/.\n\nPage 129 of 1019\n\n\fClasses for Students in Other Vanderbilt Schools and Colleges\nEnsembles\nPerformance\nGroup Performance Instruction: Non-Major\nIndividual Performance Instruction\nMusic Minors\nMusic Minor\nMusicology/Ethnomusicology Minor\nMusic Composition Minor\nMusic Performance Minor\nMusic as a Second Major\nMusic Major (Second Major)\n\nThe Blair School of Music welcomes all Vanderbilt students into its classes and studios. A large number of courses\nare designed specifically for non-majors. Many classes are held in Sarratt Cinema, Alumni Hall, and other central\ncampus locations.

Students who are approved to student teach will receive notification of their student teaching\nplacements no later than during the Student Teacher Orientation at the beginning of the student teaching semester.\n\nAll Vanderbilt teacher education programs are approved by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation\n(CAEP).\n\n3+2 B.Mus.Arts/MBA Blair-to-Owen Program\nThe five-year dual-degree program between the Blair School of Music and the Owen Graduate School of\nManagement allows a small cohort of particularly motivated students to overlap their undergraduate course work\nwith work toward the MBA, facilitating the earning of both the undergraduate and graduate degrees in five years\n(ten semesters). By combining three and one-half years in Vanderbilt’s Blair School of Music with one and one-half\nyears of study in the Owen School, students may obtain both the bachelor of musical arts and the master of business\nadministration in five years. The baccalaureate from the Blair School is awarded at the end of the fourth year, and\nthe MBA from the Owen School after the fifth year. Students interested in pursuing this program must be enrolled in\nthe musical arts degree.\n\nRequired course work includes the normal Blair course work for the musical arts degree, for a minimum of 63 credit\nhours in music. The liberal arts core will also follow the requirements for the major, but must include the following\nspecific requirements:\n\nCalculus (1 semester)\nStatistics, e.g., ECON 1500: Economic Statistics\nECON 1010: Principles of Macroeconomics\nECON 1020: Principles of Microeconomics\nECON 3012: Microeconomics\n\nA curriculum plan, including recommended electives, is provided in the Blair Student Handbook.\n\nStudents must apply to the Owen School for admission to the five-year program during their junior year. Students\nshould apply in Round 1 of the MBA application cycle (typically early October) of the junior year, and early\napplication and a standardized test score (e.g., GMAT, GRE) are recommended. Acceptance into the five-year\nprogram is extremely competitive and requires advanced standing earned in undergraduate courses. Being deficient\n\nPage 163 of 1019\n\n\fin full-time work experience, the 3+2 student must enhance their portfolio with an internship and outstanding\nacademic performance, and also show a strong commitment to a rigorous business education. The Summer\nBusiness Institute (Accelerator), as administered by the Owen Graduate School of Management, is strongly\nrecommended for 3+2 applicants prior to matriculating at Owen. The successful applicant will bring an\naccomplished academic record (normally a GPA of 3.3 or better), satisfactory internship or work experience, an\nability to articulate his or her own preparedness for the work environment, and a strong endorsement from\nVanderbilt faculty.\n\nStudents who are accepted to the 3+2 program will remain registered as B.Mus.Arts students through fall of senior\nyear, and will register as Owen students in spring of senior year. Academically, students will take a full load of\nbusiness courses both in fall and spring of senior year while completing the final B.Mus.Arts degree requirements\n(normally, lessons and ensembles). Students must complete a minimum of 62 credit hours at Owen over four\nsemesters. Fifteen hours (normally in fall of the senior year) of Owen School courses approved by Blair may be\ncounted toward completion of the undergraduate degree. Students with questions may contact Liz Scowden\n(liz.scowden@vanderbilt.edu) in the Owen Academic and Student Affairs Office. The completion of the B.Mus.Arts\ndegree requirements prior to fall of the student’s fifth year is required for continuation in the MBA program.\n\nTuition and Financial Aid\nThe scholarship or other financial aid commitment of the Blair School will not be continued automatically beyond the\nseventh semester for students enrolled in the dual-degree program. Eighth-semester financial aid is the student’s\nresponsibility. Students should notify the Owen School with their application if they are interested in being a\ncandidate for an Owen scholarship during their MBA studies. Early application is recommended. Need-based aid will\nstill apply.\n\nStudents pay tuition to the undergraduate school for the fall semester of their fourth year, after which all tuition is\npaid to Owen (and reflects graduate school tuition rates). The Blair School of Music will waive fees for the required\nperformance instruction during spring of the fourth year to facilitate completion of the B.Mus.Arts requirements.\n\nHonors in the Blair School of Music\nFounder's Medal\nAcademic Honors Designation\nHonors Program in Musicology and Ethnomusicology\nDean's List\nPi Kappa Lambda\nAwards and Prizes\nFounder’s Medal\nThe Founder’s Medal, signifying first honors, was endowed by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt as one of his gifts to\nthe university.

Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the next 12 percent of the previous three\nyears’ graduating seniors.\n\nHonors Program in Musicology and Ethnomusicology\nThe honors program in musicology and ethnomusicology is designed to afford superior students the opportunity to\npursue more intensive work within the field of musicology or ethnomusicology, culminating in the preparation of a\nsenior honors thesis. The course of study includes seminar work as well as independent study and writing under the\nsupervision of a thesis adviser. Students who want to do honors work should contact the chair of the musicology and\nethnomusicology department in the fall of their junior year. Departmental approval of a formal honors thesis\nprospectus must take place prior to registration for MUSL 4998 in spring of the junior year or fall of the senior year.\nMinimum requirements are a 3.0 GPA overall and 3.3 in musicology and ethnomusicology courses.\n\nStudents accepted into the program must take a total of 9 credit hours: MUSL 4998–4999, Senior Honors Thesis (6\nhours), and one course (beyond the MUSL core) chosen from MUSL 2610, 3160, 3220-3240, or 3890 (3 hours). In\naddition, successful completion of the honors program requires an oral defense of the honors thesis before a faculty\ncommittee. This defense will occur at the end of the second semester of thesis enrollment. Those enrolled in the\nprogram who successfully complete its requirements with distinction may graduate with Honors or Highest Honors in\nmusicology and ethnomusicology.\n\nDean’s List\nThe Dean’s List recognizes outstanding academic performance in a semester. Students are named to the Dean’s List\nwhen they earn a grade point average of at least 3.500 while carrying 12 or more graded hours, with no temporary\nor missing grades in any course (credit or non-credit), and no grade of F.\n\nPi Kappa Lambda\nElection to Pi Kappa Lambda National Music Honor Society signifies superior accomplishment in the field of music.\nStudents elected to membership must be outstanding musically and scholastically and ranked in the highest 20\npercent of the senior class or the highest 10 percent of the junior class.

Classes\noffering engineering instruction began in 1879, and seven years later Engineering was made a separate unit with its\n\nPage 170 of 1019\n\n\fown dean. The school’s program emphasizes the relationship of the engineering profession to society and prepares\nengineers to be socially aware as well as technically competent.\n\nThe mission of the School of Engineering is threefold: to produce intellectual leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators\nby recruiting the best students and providing them a top-notch education; to deliver scholarship of the highest\ncaliber, published in the most visible venues, addressing important societal problems; and to be a leader in\nentrepreneurship and innovation, in Tennessee, the U.S., and globally.\n\nThe school strives to meet the undergraduate education portion of its mission by offering degree programs in fields\nof engineering relevant to the needs of society. An objective of these programs is to provide a technical education\nintegrated with strong humanities, fine arts, and social sciences subject matter to provide the requisite foundation\nfor lifelong learning. The availability of second majors and minors in subject areas in other schools and colleges of\nthe university increases opportunities for engineering students to enhance their education by pursuing studies in\nthe non-technical disciplines. Engineering students take close to 50 percent of their courses outside of the School of\nEngineering and associate daily with peers from other schools and colleges within the university.\n\nAnother objective is to prepare students who intend to enter engineering practice upon graduation and those who\nwill continue their studies at the graduate level in engineering or in other professional fields. To this end, our\nprograms emphasize mathematics and engineering sciences with significant exposure to engineering design and\nhands-on laboratory experiences.\n\nA large fraction of the student body is destined for management positions early in their working careers. To meet\nthese students’ needs, the Engineering Management program offers a well-integrated minor.\n\nStudents at all levels have the opportunity to work with faculty in the generation of new knowledge. Those planning\nfor graduate studies and research are especially encouraged to participate in individual topics and research courses\nto fulfill that desire. Engineering students also participate in summer research programs of the university and of the\nschool.\n\nFacilities\nThe School of Engineering is housed in five main buildings with several satellite facilities. William W. Featheringill\nHall houses a three-story atrium designed for student interaction and social events, more than fifty teaching and\nresearch laboratories with the latest equipment and computer resources, and project rooms. The Engineering and\nScience Building is an eight-story state-of-the-art building that houses the Wond'ry at the Innovation Pavilion, the\nFrist Center for Autism and Innovation, numerous research labs, interactive classrooms, clean rooms, and space for\nstudents to work, study, and socialize. Olin Hall, which is attached to the Engineering and Science building, houses\nChemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Materials Science, several classrooms, and\nresearch and teaching laboratories. School administrative offices and several classrooms are located on the ground\nfloor of the Science and Engineering Building in Stevenson Center, which also houses the Biomedical Engineering\ndepartment on the 8th and 9th floors. Jacobs Hall, which flanks Featheringill Hall, contains laboratories, offices, and\nclassrooms serving the Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering departments.\nLabs, offices, and meeting spaces for Computer Science are also housed at 17th & DeFord Bailey, a building that\nserves as a hub for Computer Science and Data Science. Several satellite facilities are also part of the Engineering\nSchool: the W. M. Keck Free-Electron Laser Center building, housing the labs and offices of the Biomedical Photonics\nCenter; the Laboratory for Systems Integrity and Reliability (LASIR), an off-campus hangar-style facility dedicated to\nscaling up experiments to realistic and full size that houses a wind tunnel and military aircraft; the Vanderbilt\nInstitute of Software Integrated Systems; and the Institute for Space and Defense Electronics.\n\nIn all its engineering programs, Vanderbilt recognizes the vital place of experimental and research laboratories in\nthe learning experience. Laboratories are designed to provide the strongest personal contact between students and\nfaculty members consistent with enrollment.\n\nPage 171 of 1019\n\n\fWell-equipped undergraduate laboratories are maintained by the Chemistry and Physics & Astronomy departments\nin the College of Arts and Science, which offers mathematics and basic science courses required of all engineering\nstudents. Graduate and undergraduate divisions of these departments maintain teaching and research facilities in\nthe Stevenson Center for the Natural Sciences. Another supporting department, Biological Sciences, is housed in\nMedical Research Building III. Most classes in humanities and the social sciences are conducted in Buttrick, Calhoun,\nFurman, Garland, and Wilson halls.\n\nProfessional Registration and Accreditation\nLegislation exists in the various states requiring registration of all engineers who contract with the public to perform\nprofessional work. Although many engineering positions do not require professional certification, Vanderbilt\nsupports registration and encourages its graduates to take the Fundamentals of Engineering examination as soon as\nthey become eligible.\n\nBachelor of engineering degrees in biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical and\ncomputer engineering, and mechanical engineering are accredited as noted below. Students in these programs may\ntake the Fundamentals of Engineering examination as seniors. In addition, proven professional experience is a\nrequirement for registration. Some state boards may have additional requirements for licensure.\n\nAll programs leading to the Bachelor of Engineering degree and the program leading to the Bachelor of Science in\ncomputer science are accredited as follows:\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in biomedical engineering is accredited by the Engineering\nAccreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for\nBioengineering and Biomedical and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in civil engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation\nCommission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for Civil and\nSimilarly Named Engineering Programs.\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in chemical engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation\nCommission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for Chemical,\nBiochemical, Biomolecular and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.\n\nThe Bachelor of Science program in computer science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of\nABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and Program Criteria for Computer Science and Similarly\nNamed Computing Programs. The accredited program in computer science is the primary major administered by the\nSchool of Engineering. Computer science added as a second major by students outside the School of Engineering is\nnot an accredited program.\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in electrical and computer engineering is accredited by the\nEngineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program\nCriteria for Electrical, Computer, Communications, Telecommunication(s) and Similarly Named Engineering\nPrograms.\n\nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in mechanical engineering is accredited by the the Engineering\nAccreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for\n\nPage 172 of 1019\n\n\fMechanical and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.\nEmployment of Graduates\nOf the recent Vanderbilt graduates with baccalaureate degrees in engineering, about 75 percent entered directly\ninto professional practice. Twenty-five percent continued with graduate or professional education. Others pursued\ndiverse careers or other interests. Additional information regarding the employment of engineering graduates is\navailable on the School of Engineering's website and in the VU Career Center.\nSupporting Organizations\n\nVanderbilt Engineering Council\nThe Engineering Council is a student organization whose main goal is facilitating community among undergraduate\nstudents in the School of Engineering by organizing activities, e.g., Engineering Week, de-stress events around final\nexaminations, and many more. Additionally, the council acts as a student voice to school administration and faculty.\nRepresentatives of engineering student organizations apply to serve on the E-Council leadership team, and the\ncurrent leadership board selects and trains the new members. While the council has no administrative power, it\nprovides students with a voice in the decision- making process in the School of Engineering.\n\nProfessional Societies\nThe leading national engineering societies have chartered branches or student sections at Vanderbilt. These\norganizations are run locally by students with the help of a faculty adviser. Meetings are devoted to matters of a\ntechnical nature, including outside speakers, plant trips, and other subjects of interest to the membership.\n\nStudents are invited to attend meetings and join as they will find the work of the professional societies beneficial in\norienting them in their careers.\n\nThe student professional societies are:\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n(A.I.A.A.)\nAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers (AICh.E)\nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers (A.S.C.E.)\nAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers (A.S.M.E)\nBiomedical Engineering Society\nEngineering World Health (E.W.H.)\nEngineers Without Borders (E.W.B.)\n\nInstitute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (I.E.E.E.)\nNational Society of Black Engineers (N.S.B.E.)\nSociety of Asian Scientists and Engineers (S.A.S.E.)\nSociety of Hispanic Professional Engineers (S.H.P.E.)\nSociety of Automotive Engineers (S.A.E.)\nSociety of Women Engineers (S.W.E.)\nWomen in Computing\n\nThe student Honor Societies are:\nTau Beta Pi\n\nAlpha Eta Mu Beta\n\nGraduating seniors may join the Order of the Engineer, a society that recognizes the commitment of its members to\nthe profession of engineering.\n\nIn addition to student chapters of national professional societies, the School of Engineering also hosts a number of\nadditional student organizations.\n\nDegree Programs in Engineering\nPage 173 of 1019\n\n\fDegree Programs in Engineering\nUndergraduate Degrees\nThe First Year\nMathematics and Physics\nLiberal Arts Core\nImmersion\nOpen Electives\nOfficer Education\nMaster of Engineering\nDigital Learning Programs\n\nBachelor of engineering degree programs are offered in the areas of biomedical, chemical, civil, electrical and\ncomputer, environmental, and mechanical engineering. Many of these programs allow considerable flexibility—but\nstudents are required to include in their courses of study those bodies of knowledge fundamental to that discipline.\n\nBachelor of science degree programs are offered in computer science and engineering science. The latter\ninterdisciplinary engineering discipline allows strong concentration in other areas of engineering or outside of the\nSchool of Engineering.\n\nThe school offers the master of engineering (M.Eng.), with emphasis on engineering design and practice, in most\nareas of study. The Graduate School, through departments of the School of Engineering, offers the research-oriented\nPh.D. and M.S. degrees in eight major fields. Degree programs offered by the School of Engineering are shown\nbelow.\n\nDegree Programs in Engineering\nB.E.\n\nB.S.\n\nM.Eng.\n\nM.S.\n\nPh.D.\n\nBiomedical Engineering\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nChemical Engineering\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nCivil Engineering\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nComputer Science\n\n•\n\nCyber-Physical Systems\nElectrical and Computer Engineering\n\n•\n•\n\nEngineering in Surgery and Intervention\n\n•\n\nEngineering Management\n\n•\n\nEngineering Science\nEnvironmental Engineering\n\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nInterdisciplinary Materials Science\nMechanical Engineering\nRisk, Reliability, and Resilience Engineering\n\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nPage 174 of 1019\n\n\fUndergraduate Degrees\nThe First Year\nMost courses normally scheduled for the first year are common to both the B.E. and B.S. degree programs. While the\ncurriculum for the first year is generally the same for all students, there are important variations. For example, some\nmajor programs require a full year of introductory chemistry; others do not. Students should become familiar with\nrequirements of those programs in which they have an interest and confer with their adviser at the time of\nenrollment and throughout the first year to plan a program of study that will keep options open as long as possible.\n\nSpecimen curricula for the engineering programs are given in the Courses of Study section. Requirements for the\nB.E. and B.S. degrees for the various programs vary in the minimum amount of hours and in specific course\nrequirements in the basic sciences and in mathematics.\n\nIncluded in the first year for all majors is the course Engineering Science 1401–1403 Introduction to Engineering,\nwhich introduces the student to design tools used in all areas of engineering.\nMathematics and Physics\nEntering engineering students will be placed in the appropriate level mathematics course. Students having one full\nyear or more of high school credit in analytic geometry and calculus may qualify for advanced placement in a\nregular sequence by scoring well on the Advanced Placement Examination.\n\nStudents with high mathematical ability and achievement as demonstrated by testing credit or credit by\nexamination through the Department of Mathematics may begin in the next mathematics course for which they\nqualify (e.g., MATH 1301 or 2300). For more information, see the testing credit information under Advanced Credit in\nthe Admissions section of this catalog and course descriptions under Mathematics in the Arts and Science section of\nthis catalog. For majors requiring Math 2420 (Methods of Ordinary Differential Equations), students may select Math\n2400 (Differential Equations with Linear Algebra) or Math 2610 (Ordinary Differential Equations) as a substitute.\n\nFirst-year students with a test score of 5 on the Calculus-BC Advanced Placement examination and who wish to\npursue the honors track of a second major in mathematics may take MATH 2500-2501, which will cover the material\nfrom MATH 2300 and 2600 but in a deeper and integrated fashion. Note that while linear algebra is required for\nsome VUSE majors, no VUSE major specifically requires 2600. Students considering this option must discuss this\nwith the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Mathematics and the School of Engineering Office of Academic\nServices.\n\nStudents with inadequate backgrounds in mathematics may be required to take Math 1005 (Pre-calculus\nMathematics). Taking this course constitutes an additional requirement for graduation.\n\nMath 1010-1011 (Probability and Statistical Inference) and Math 1100 (Survey of Calculus) cannot be credited\ntoward a degree in the School of Engineering.\n\nStudents with greater interest in physics may enroll in Phys 1911, 1912, 1912L, and 2255L (Principles of Physics I\nand II and labs) as substitutes for Phys 1601, 1602, 1601L, and 1602L (General Physics I and II and labs),\nrespectively. Students should consult with their Academic Adviser before taking this more advanced Physics\nsequence.\n\nPre-calculus courses Phys 1010, 1010L, 1020, 1020L, 2051, 2052, 2053, and 2054 cannot be credited toward a\ndegree in the School of Engineering.\n\nPage 175 of 1019\n\n\fLiberal Arts Core\nIn order to provide the elements of a general education considered necessary for responsible practice as an\neducated engineer, the School of Engineering requires each student to complete at least 18 hours in the Liberal Arts\nCore comprising:\n1. At least 3 hours selected from courses classified in the AXLE Curriculum Course Distribution as Humanities\nand Creative Arts (HCA), with the exception of CMST 1500, 2100, 2110, and 2120, and\n2. At least 3 hours selected from courses classified in the AXLE Curriculum Course Distribution as Social and\nBehavioral Sciences (SBS).\nThe remaining hours are to be selected from:\n1. Courses classified in the AXLE Curriculum Course Distribution as Humanities and Creative Arts (HCA),\nInternational Cultures (INT), History and Culture of the United States (US), Social and Behavioral Sciences\n(SBS), and Perspectives (P)\n2. CS 1151 and ENGM 2440\n3. ARA, CHEB, CHIN, FREN, GER, GRK, HEBR, HNUR, ITA, JAPN, KICH, KOR, LAT, RUSS, SNSK, and SPAN courses\nnumbered 1101; CHIN and JAPN courses numbered 1011 and 1012; and ENGL and SPAN courses numbered\n1100\n4. AP Credit for AADS 2000 (earned from the AP African American Studies exam).\n5. Peabody College courses in Psychology (PSY-PC) numbered 1205, 1207, 1250, 2200, 2250, 2300, 2400, 2500,\n2550, 2600, and 3150, and in Human and Organizational Development (HOD) numbered 1250, 1300, 2100,\n2260, 2400, 2500, 2700, and HODC 3232\n6. All MUSO, COMP, MREP, MUTH, and performance courses in the Blair School of Music, except MUSO 1001\n7. MS 1510\nImmersion\nImmersion Vanderbilt (vanderbilt.edu/immersion) allows students to pursue a multi-year path to be curious, to\ndevelop their passions and to learn by experience. To fulfill the university requirement of Immersion Vanderbilt, a\nstudent must participate in immersive experiences and then complete a culminating project that is based on one\nspecific immersive experience as described in the Special Programs for Undergraduates section near the start of this\ncatalog.\nThe experiential learning may focus on one or more areas of student interest. Most engineering students will take\nadvantage of a four-year engineering design experience to satisfy the requirements of Immersion Vanderbilt. Each\nengineering major offers such a multi-year experience within its curriculum. Students whose plans include\nprofessional development may also pursue industrial internships. A research path can engage the student in\ndiscovery through research in engineering or other fields. While most engineering students will select an immersion\nexperience associated with their major, students can pursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. For\nexample, students interested in creative expression might develop a performance piece, exhibit, or artistic work,\nwhile those interested in international study may explore firsthand the culture, language, and history of other\ncountries. Students interested in such immersion plans should consult the Office of Experiential Learning and\nImmersion (EL&IV).\n\nThe Immersion Vanderbilt process is composed of several phases. Senior design projects in the School of\nEngineering satisfy the final project requirement for Immersion Vanderbilt, with students presenting the results of\ntheir design project at the school's Design Day or Computer Science Immersion Showcase. For students completing\nother immersion projects, the Office of Experiential Learning and Immersion Vanderbilt coordinates a series of\nshowcases open to the entire campus where students display their projects. Upon completion of the project, Office\nof Experiential Learning and Immersion Vanderbilt conveys that the requirements have been met by showing\ncompletion of the Immersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement on the student's degree audit.\nOpen Electives\nCourses taken beyond specified courses and restricted (such as program, technical, and liberal arts) electives for the\nmajor may be taken as open electives.\nOfficer Education\nCourse offerings in military science and naval science are described in the section on Special Programs for\n\nPage 176 of 1019\n\n\fUndergraduates near the beginning of the catalog. All officer education courses designated as eligible for credit may\nbe taken as open electives. In addition, some officer education courses in history and political science may be taken\nas part of the Liberal Arts Core while some officer education courses in engineering science may be taken as\ntechnical electives. AFROTC students may count 6 hours of the military courses as open electives.\n\nMaster of Engineering\nThe master of engineering (M.Eng.) is an advanced professional degree awarded by the School of Engineering and\nespecially designed for engineering practitioners who may prefer to work while doing professional study. It is also\nsuitable for individuals who apply directly from undergraduate school—but the thrust of the program is toward\nprofessional practice in engineering rather than research or teaching. The degree is offered in biomedical\nengineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, cyber-physical systems, engineering in surgery and\nintervention, engineering management, environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, and risk, reliability,\nand resilience engineering.\n\nStudents must complete 30 hours of approved course work. A maximum of 6 hours of graduate-level course work\nmay be transferred from another institution, and a maximum period of seven years is allowed to complete the\ndegree. An extensive, written design report shall be submitted on a project approved by the student’s project\nadviser.\n\nRegular admission to the Master of Engineering program normally requires graduation from an approved\nundergraduate program in engineering or a related scientific discipline, attainment of a B average in undergraduate\ncourses applicable to the student’s career goals, and recommendations containing favorable appraisals of\nprofessional promise and attitude. A period of successful work experience prior to application to the program will\nalso be given consideration. For information about admissions, application procedures, and application deadlines for\nthe Master of Engineering programs, please visit https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/academics/master-ofengineering-degree.\n\nCurrent undergraduates in the School of Engineering may be eligible to earn the Master of Engineering via the\nIntegrated Bachelor and Master of Engineering program described in the next section of this catalog.\n\nFor international students who did not graduate from an institution in a country where English is the official\nlanguage, proficiency in English must be shown by a minimum score of 89 on the TOEFL or 7 on the IELTS test.\n\nDigital Learning Programs\nThe School of Engineering offers two degree programs online: an M.S. in Computer Science, and an M.Eng. in\nEngineering Management.

Honors programs of each major are described in the Courses of Study section.\n\nRequirements vary somewhat but, in general, to qualify for consideration a student should have (a) completed the\ntechnical course requirements of the first two years, (b) attained a minimum grade average of 3.5 in all work taken\nfor credit, and (c) shown evidence indicating a capacity for independent study and/or research. Formal admission is\nby election of the department concerned. Once admitted, candidates remain in the program only if they maintain a\n3.5 or higher grade point average.\n\nAccepted candidates normally begin honors study in the junior year, but exceptions may be made for outstanding\nseniors.\n\nSuccessful candidates are awarded Honors in their major. This designation appears on their diplomas.\nStudy Abroad\nVanderbilt's Global Education Office offers approximately thirty programs that allow students to take engineering or\ncomputer science courses in English abroad, in locations ranging from Dublin to Sydney, Madrid to Hong Kong.\nThere are no language prerequisites for these programs. These programs also allow students to take a range of\nliberal arts core, major core, and elective courses abroad. In no case, after matriculating at Vanderbilt, may a\nstudent participate in a Vanderbilt-approved study abroad program through a different university or through an\nexternal agency and then seek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt. Financial aid can be used for study abroad\nduring the academic year, and scholarships are available to support Vanderbilt-approved summer study abroad\noptions. Students are encouraged to discuss with their academic advisers how best to incorporate study abroad into\ntheir four-year plans of study. All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt’s\ninternational security provider.\n\nRegistration is completed on your behalf when enrolling in a program offered through the Global Education Office.\nOtherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.\nTeacher Education\nStudents who are interested in preparing for licensure as secondary school teachers should plan their programs in\nconsultation with the associate dean in the School of Engineering and the Director of Secondary Education in the\nDepartment of Teaching and Learning at Peabody College. More specific information on professional education\ncourse requirements can be found under the Licensure for Teaching chapter in the Peabody College section of this\ncatalog. Inquiries can also be made to the Office of Teacher Licensure at Peabody.\nSecond Major\nIt is possible for a student to combine an engineering field with a second area outside the School of Engineering.\nThe student must obtain prior approval of each department and satisfy the requirements of each major, including\nthe requirement regarding minimum grade point average. Students in the School of Engineering may use courses\noutside the School of Engineering for relevant second majors even if those courses also fulfill a degree requirement.\n\nCertain double majors involving two programs within the School of Engineering have been approved by the faculty.\nThe approved double majors are biomedical engineering/electrical and computer engineering, and biomedical\nengineering/chemical engineering.\n\nPage 178 of 1019\n\n\fBoth majors are indicated on the student’s transcript. Only one degree is awarded, from the school in which the\nstudent is enrolled.\nMinors\nA minor consists of at least five courses of at least 3 credit hours each within a recognized area of knowledge. A\nminor offers students more than a casual introduction to an area, but less than a major. A minor is not a degree\nrequirement, but students may elect to complete one or more. Courses may not be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. A\nminor for which all designated courses are completed with a grade point average of at least 2.000 will be entered on\nthe transcript at the time of graduation.\n\nWhen a minor is offered in a discipline that offers a major, only those courses that count toward the major may be\ncounted toward the minor. Students should refer to the appropriate sections of this catalog for specific\nrequirements. Minors are offered in engineering management, materials science and engineering, computer\nscience, data science, digital fabrication, electrical and computer engineering, energy and environmental systems,\nenvironmental engi​neering, nanoscience and nanotechnology, quantum information science and engineering,\nscientific computing, and most disciplines of the College of Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, and Peabody\nCollege.\n\nStudents declare their intention to pursue a minor by completing the online Major/Minor Declaration/Change\nworkflow process found here: https://registrar.vanderbilt.edu/registration/forms.php. Departments and programs\nusually assign advisers to students who declare minors in their areas. Students are responsible for knowing and\nsatisfying all requirements for the minors they intend to complete.\nFocus Areas\nFocus areas provide guidance to students wishing to concentrate on a specialized topic within engineering. Focus\nareas are typically nine credit hours, and qualifying courses are listed in the catalog. Students can declare a\nmaximum of three focus areas; however, a qualifying course cannot be applied to more than one focus area.\nStudents interested in declaring a focus area must do so before the start of their final semester at Vanderbilt.\nSuccessful completion of a declared focus area will be designated on a student's transcript upon graduation.\nThe School of Engineering offers the following focus areas:\nHuman Computer Interaction\nMicroelectronics\nNanotechnology\nStrategic and Technical Consulting\nEngineering Communications\nTechnology Entrepreneurship\nProduct Development\nDual Degree Program with Fisk University\nA coordinated dual degree program between the Vanderbilt University School of Engineering and Fisk University is\nespecially designed to permit students to obtain an A.B. degree in biology, chemistry, computer science, physics, or\nmathematics from Fisk and a B.E. degree in engineering from Vanderbilt, generally within five years.\n\nFor the first three years, the student is enrolled at Fisk in a science or mathematics curriculum and, by crossregistration in the second and third years, takes introductory engineering courses at Vanderbilt. During the fourth\nand fifth years, the student is enrolled at Vanderbilt, following principally an engineering curriculum at Vanderbilt\nand completing necessary courses at Fisk. At the end of five years, the student should be able to satisfy the\nrequirements for both bachelor’s degrees.\n\nFinancial aid is available for qualified, deserving students. Additional information is available from the director of\n\nPage 179 of 1019\n\n\ftransfer admissions in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\nIntegrated Bachelor and Master of Engineering\nOn the basis of recommendations containing favorable appraisals of professional promise, undergraduate students\nin the School of Engineering who have completed at least 75 hours by the end of the second year with at least a\n3.500 grade point average may be accepted into an integrated Bachelor of Engineering–Master of Engineering\nprogram. This program is currently available in chemical, civil, environmental, or mechanical engineering. This\nprogram can also be completed with the Master of Engineering degree in Engineering in Surgery and Intervention\n(ESI) in combination with the bachelor's degree in biomedical, mechanical, electrical and computer engineering, or\nengineering science. The last two years of a student’s program are planned as a unit.\n\nWith the approval of the student’s adviser, the director of graduate studies in the student’s major department, and\nthe senior associate dean for undergraduate education, students apply through the senior associate dean for\ngraduate education for admission to this integrated dual degree program. Upon admission to this program, a\nsecond “career” will be set up for the student which will allow the student to start taking graduate courses (course\nnumbers > 5000) during the junior and senior years. These courses will be credited toward the master of\nengineering.\n\nNote that no double counting of courses is allowed (i.e., the student must meet the degree requirements for each\ndegree independent of the other degree). No more than 18 total credit hours between the two careers can be taken\nin a single semester. The student typically receives the bachelor’s degree at the end of the fourth year and\ncompletes the master of engineering during the fifth year. Further information can be obtained from the director of\ngraduate studies of the student’s major department.\nAccelerated Graduate Program in Engineering\nStudents who enter Vanderbilt with a significant number of credits, earned either through Advanced Placement or\nInternational Baccalaureate tests or in college courses taken during high school, may be eligible for the Accelerated\nGraduate Program in Engineering. Through this program, a student is able to earn both a bachelor’s degree and a\nmaster of science in about the same time required for the bachelor’s degree or slightly longer. To be eligible for the\nprogram, a student must complete 86 hours (senior standing) by the end of the sophomore year with at least a\n3.500 grade point average. With the approval of the student’s adviser, the director of graduate studies in the\nstudent’s major department, and the senior associate dean for undergraduate education, students apply through the\nsenior associate dean for graduate education for admission to this accelerated dual degree program. Upon\nadmission to this program, a second “career” will be set up for the student which will allow the student to start\ntaking graduate courses (course numbers > 5000) during the junior and senior years. These courses will be credited\ntoward the master of science.\n\nNote that no double counting of courses is allowed (i.e., the student must meet the degree requirements for each\ndegree independent of the other degree). No more than 18 total credit hours between the two careers can be taken\nin a single semester. The student receives the bachelor’s degree at the end of the fourth year and typically spends\nthe summer finishing a master’s thesis to complete the master of science. Further information can be obtained from\nthe director of graduate studies of the student’s major department.\n\nHonors in the School of Engineering\nFounder's Medal\nLatin Honors Designation\nDean's List\nHonor Societies\nOther Awards and Prizes\nFounder’s Medal\n\nPage 180 of 1019\n\n\fThe Founder’s Medal, signifying first honors, was endowed by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt as one of his gifts to\nthe university.

Lewis, Marlon Thomas\n\nCOURSES OFFERED: BME\n\nThe foundations of biomedical engineering are the same as those in other engineering disciplines: mathematics,\nphysics, chemistry, and engineering principles. Biomedical engineering builds on these foundations to solve\nproblems in biology and medicine over the widest range of scales-from the nanoscale and molecular levels to the\nwhole body. Biomedical engineering provides a robust platform for employment in the medical device and\ninstrumentation industries as well as careers in companies that specialize in the development and application of\nbiologics, biomaterials, computation, implants and processes. Our graduates gain entry into nationally recognized\ngraduate schools for continuing studies in biomedical engineering.\n\nBiomedical engineering is also a rigorous path for admission to and success in medical school for those students\n\nPage 185 of 1019\n\n\fwilling and able to excel in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and engineering.\n\nThe Department of Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt is unique among biomedical engineering programs in its\nimmediate proximity to the world class Vanderbilt Medical Center, located on our compact campus. Our School of\nMedicine is among the top ten in funding from the National Institutes of Health and includes a National Cancer\nInstitute- recognized Comprehensive Cancer Center, a major children’s hospital and a Level I trauma center. This\nproximity and the strong relationships among faculty across multiple schools stimulate high impact research and\nprovide unique educational and research opportunities for students.\n\nDegree Programs. The Department of Biomedical Engineering offers courses of study leading to the B.E., M.S.,\nM.Eng., and Ph.D. Vanderbilt biomedical engineering is a well-established program with undergraduate degrees\ngranted continuously since 1965. Our undergraduate curriculum undergoes regular review and revision to ensure\nrelevancy and to maintain full ABET accreditation. Students have complete flexibility in the selection of biomedical\nengineering, technical, and open electives. This allows students to design their own focus areas such as\nregenerative medicine and tissue engineering, wearables and point-of-care diagnostics, global health, surgery and\nengineering, robotics and prosthetics, lasers and medicine, medical imaging, biotechnology and nanomedicine,\nmedical technology and entrepreneurship.\n\nFacilities. The Department of Biomedical Engineering is located in Stevenson Center. Undergraduate instructional\nlaboratories are equipped for study of biomedical processes, measurement methods and instrumentation. These\nfacilities are equipped with embedded systems for instrumentation, design, and testing that mirror professional\npractice. Specialized facilities for biomedical imaging, biophotonics, cell and tissue culture, microfabrication, surgery\nand intervention, and nanoengineering are used both for faculty-led research and instructional purposes.\n\nUndergraduate Honors Program. With approval of the Honors Program director, junior and senior students in\nbiomedical engineering who have achieved a minimum grade point average of 3.5 may be accepted into the\nundergraduate Honors Program. Students in the program take at least 6 credit hours of 5000-level or above\n(graduate) biomedical engineering courses, which can be counted toward the 127-hour undergraduate degree\nrequirements as biomedical engineering electives or which can be taken for graduate school credit. Students in the\nHonors Program must also complete a two-semester-long research project and present a research report; this is\ngenerally accomplished through the BME 3860 and 3861 Undergraduate Research elective courses. Honors students\nmust make a grade point average of 3.0 in these classes and maintain an overall 3.5 GPA to be designated as an\nhonors graduate.
